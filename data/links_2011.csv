Wenders considered abandoning the project but after meeting with the members of her dance company Tanztheater Wuppertal Wenders chose instead to create a cinematic interpretation of Bausch's art preserving several of her pieces and the work of her dancers for the ages. Pina is the result a performance film that takes several of Bausch's dance pieces into the open and celebrates the beauty and physicality of dance; the film was shot in 3D to give a greater sense of the power and interplay of bodies in motion. Pina received its North American premiere at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival., Pina Bausch, Tanztraume | First Position | Cave of Forgotten Dreams | Never Stand Still: Dancing at Jacob's Pillow | Passione | Lord of the Dance

When we first meet Rango (voice of Johnny Depp) the sheltered pet chameleon is safe in his terrarium and embarking on epic adventures through the power of imagination. Then suddenly his safe existence is irrevocably upended thanks to a bump in the road that sends him soaring out of a car window and right onto the searing-hot asphalt of a desert highway. On the advice of a wise armadillo who relays the story of the Spirit of the West our conical-eyed hero sets out in search of a town called Dirt narrowly escaping a hungry hawk and encountering a self-sufficient pioneer named Beans (voice of Isla Fisher) along the way. Upon arriving in the dusty desert town Rango wanders into the local bar and convinces the townspeople that he's a notorious gunslinger with a lightning-fast trigger finger. When one of the locals challenges Rango to a showdown on Main Street the hawk that menaced our hero on his way to town shows up looking for a rematch and ends up beak-down in the dirt. Convinced that Rango is the real deal the Mayor (voice of Ned Beatty) decides to name the brave chameleon their new sheriff. But Rango's honeymoon in Dirt is short-lived when bandits steal the town's entire supply of water and the newly christened sheriff forms a posse in order to get it back. Little do they realize they were all being manipulated by one greedy power-monger who's determined to keep the people of Dirt under his thumb with the help of a diabolical villain named Rattlesnake Jake (voice of Bill Nighy) whose Gatling-gun tail makes Swiss cheese of all challengers. Now if Rango can just locate the Spirit of the West (voice of Timothy Olyphant) and summon the courage to realize his true potential perhaps he can finally free the people of Dirt from the tyranny that binds them and discover his true destiny under the scorching desert sun., Johnny Depp | Isla Fisher | Abigail Breslin | Ned Beatty | Alfred Molina | Bill Nighy | Harry Dean Stanton | Ray Winstone | Timothy Olyphant | Stephen Root | Ian Abercrombie | Gil Birmingham | James Ward Byrkit | Claudia Black | Blake Clark | John Cothran Jr. | Patrika Darbo | George Del Hoyo | Maile Flanagan | Charles Fleischer | Beth Grant | Ryan Hurst | Vincent Kartheiser | Hemky Madera | Alex Manugian | Joseph A.

Convinced that the once-prolific Paul Williams has passed away as he scours the Internet to purchase one of his albums Kessler discovers to his surprise that not only is Williams alive and well but he's also still performing regularly to adoring fans around the world. Like many teens of the 1970s and '80s Kessler connected with Williams' pensive poetic songs about love and loneliness and upon learning that he would be performing at a Winnipeg screening of Phantom of the Paradise (panned by critics the notorious Brian De Palma bomb was a massive hit in just two cities: Winnipeg and Paris) the filmmaker convinces Williams to be profiled in a documentary. At first Williams is somewhat aloof yet Kessler persists and in time makes a breakthrough by bonding with the performer over his favorite seafood. Meanwhile as Kessler begins exploring the highs and lows of Williams' career the subject pulls the storyteller into the film and a close friendship begins to develop. Later Kessler tags along with Williams for a concert in the Philippines where their bond is cemented during a tense bus ride through the Mindanao jungle. As a result the filmmaker gets the one thing he's craved since one of his earliest meetings with Williams though when it seems to go awry he fears that he may have betrayed his new friend's trust., Paul Williams | Stephen Kessler | Dustin Hoffman | Johnny Carson | Burt Reynolds | Helen Reddy | Angie Dickinson | Willie Nelson | Warren Beatty | Telly Savalas | Deborah Harry | Robert Blake | Dick Clark | Gabe Kaplan | Peter Lawford | Barbra Streisand | Pat McCormick | John Travolta | Jason Mraz | Jack Klugman | Tony Randall | Ed McMahon | Robert Redford | Loretta Swit, The Devil and Daniel Johnston | Wesley Willis's Joy Rides | Jandek on Corwood | Searching for Sugar Man | The Weird World of Blowfly | Winnebago Man

Nik (Tristan Halilaj) is a teenager growing up in a small village in Albania; he has little interest in his father's baking business and is more concerned with surfing the Internet hanging out with his friends and trying to impress Bardha (Zana Hasaj) a pretty girl he knows from school. But whatever future Nik might hope for is put on hold when his father Mark (Refet Abazi) revives a long-standing feud over a land dispute with his neighbor Sokol (Veton Osmani) leading to a violent confrontation that claims Sokol's life. An ancient Albanian tradition has it that the survivors of a violent murder can kill a man from the family that committed the crime without consequence; however they can only do so in the open so Nik and the other men in his household are only safe as long as they stay in their home. As Nik's sister Rudina (Sindi Lacej) takes over the family business his world is reduced to the inside of the family residence which proves to be almost as maddening as the possibility of being murdered.

This mode of observation was particularly interesting for audiences given Mekas' constant immersion in celebrity circles: It provided the opportunity to see icons such as John Lennon and Yoko Ono outside of the limelight. Mekas returns to the form at age 88 with this outing; presented as a series of sketch-filled chapters it may strike many viewers as more accessible than the director's prior work. It constitutes a sequel to A Letter from Greenpoint and picks up where that opus left off: Mekas has just moved into a new Brooklyn apartment and suffers from chronic insomnia. Soon however he grows restless and undertakes a series of adventures at home and abroad often accompanied by famous friends. These escapades include visits with Harmony Korine just before and after his son Lefty is born a jam session with composer Pip Chodorov in Luxembourg an encounter with French heartthrob Louis Garrel in Paris and a ride to the airport with Bjork., Marina Abramovic | Pip Chodorov | Louis Garrel | Flo Jacobs | Ken Jacobs | Harmony Korine | Adolfas Mekas | Jonas Mekas | Benn Northover | Yoko Ono | Patti Smith, Boyhood | The Sound of Insects: Record of a Mummy | Life of Pi | Samsara | Naqoyqatsi | The Mirror

Yoshihiro Tatsumi was born in 1935; his early childhood took place as Japan was mired in World War II and some of his earliest memories coincided with Japan's loss in the war and the subsequent changes of the post-war era. Tatsumi also grew up in a poor household with three siblings and when he discovered his talent for cartooning as a young teenager he was soon encouraged to put his skills to work to help support the family. Tatsumi began selling his work to leading Japanese comic publishers and he found inspiration in the work of Osamu Tezuka a leading artist who struck it big as the creator of the Japanese animated series Astro Boy. However Tatsumi grew frustrated with the creative limitations of conventional comic books which were aimed towards a younger audience; he spearheaded a new genre of Japanese comics known as gekiga ("dramatic pictures") which told bold stories intended for adult audiences and often featured graphic content. The film Tatsumi tells the story of the artist's early life and rise to fame while also dealing with his difficult relationships with others and the evolution of his work into increasingly disturbing themes. Tatsumi himself narrates the film with the art and character design closely following his own style. The film also incorporates animated adaptations of five of Tatsumi's better known stories from throughout his career.

At the same time Kesey also had a strong bohemian streak and in the late '50s had been a volunteer in a research experiment sponsored by the United States military on the effects of an unusual new drug called LSD. Kesey came to believe the LSD experience had the power to reshape America's psychological and spiritual landscape and he continued using it with a handful of trusted friends and colleagues. In 1964 Kesey and several of his fellow psychedelic explorers -- including Neal Cassady a close friend of Jack Kerouac who helped inspire the book On the Road -- bought a 1939 International Harvester school bus fixed it up with bunks painted it with bright abstract designs and set out on a cross-country voyage to explore America and share their new vision with those they met. In time Kesey and his "Merry Pranksters" were credited with launching the counterculture revolution of the 1960s and as they traveled from place to place they documented their adventures on 16 mm film. However due to sound synchronization problems the footage was never edited into useable form but filmmakers Alex Gibney and Alison Ellwood have used this material as the basis for a documentary on the journey of the Pranksters and its cultural influence. Magic Trip: Ken Kesey's Search for a Cool Place explores the history behind Kesey and his group offers a look at their experiences on the road and includes footage of some of the friends they encountered en route including Allen Ginsberg Jack Kerouac and a rock band called the Warlocks who would later change their name to the Grateful Dead.

One thing Papua New Guinea does have is a beautiful coastline and while body surfing has been popular among the locals for a long time surfboards were unknown there until 1980 when an Australian pilot mistakenly left his behind during a stop in the city of Vanimo.

Adam Pesce offers a look into the Papua New Guinea surfing scene and the high stakes of competition in the documentary Splinters. The film also profiles a number of aspiring surfing champions including two sisters striving to make a name for themselves in a male-dominated sport and a pair of close friends who become fierce rivals on the waves.

In 2009 alone 16150 service members were sexually assaulted. Meanwhile it's estimated that female soldiers in the U.S. military are more likely to be raped by a male soldier than shot by an enemy combatant. Despite the overwhelming evidence presented by these victimized soldiers however only 2% of rape accusations in the military end in prosecution. In some cases male soldiers have even been awarded medals for bravery and professionalism while being investigated for rape. In addition to hearing from women who have been sexually assaulted while serving their country we also learn how systemic corruption allows the vast majority of their attackers to walk free and what is now being done to ensure that no crime goes unpunished., Amy Ziering | Kirby Dick | Loree Sutton | Susan Burke | Amy Herdy | Chellie Pingree | Loretta Sanchez, Seeds of Summer | Voices of Iraq | Restrepo | Soldiers Pay

In the years that followed however Adam and Emma continued to cross paths until eventually they both caved to their animal instincts. Despite an intense session of earth-shaking sex however Emma makes it clear to Adam that the last thing she wants is a committed relationship. And thanks to the fact that Adam's father (Kevin Kline) a fallen television star has just begun dating his son's ex-girlfriend the horrified bachelor has developed an aversion to monogamy as well. At first their casual stance on sex works great for both; Emma can focus on her career instead of allowing her emotions to dictate her decisions and Adam can play the field without fear of hurting her feelings. Over time though a funny thing happens -- Adam begins to develop feelings for Emma that he never had for any of his countless conquests. Before they both know it love has reared its ugly head and they've gotten too emotionally involved to cut the relationship off cold.

Edgar Hoover. For nearly 50 years Hoover (DiCaprio) fought crime as one of the most powerful law enforcers in America. During Hoover's extended stint as Director of the FBI however his penchant for bending the law in the name of seeking justice and using the secrets of high profile leaders to gain personal leverage won him just as many supporters as detractors. Little did many other than his loyal colleague Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) and faithful secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) know however that Hoover himself was a man with many secrets to hide.

Qalli (Josiah Patkotak) and Aivaaq (Frank Qutuq Irelan) are two 17-year-old boys growing up in the Inupiaq community of Barrow Alaska. While Barrow is at first glance an old-fashioned community cut off from major urban centers and a place where men still hunt seals and walruses to put food on the table the town shows a few signs of big-city life; the teenagers like to race snowmobiles and listen to hip-hop and there's also a growing crystal-meth problem. Qalli and Aivaaq have known each other since early childhood and are as close as siblings but they come from very different households -- Qalli has a tight-knit family and has plans to attend college while Aivaaq is the son of a single mom and has a pregnant girlfriend to look after. One day Qalli sees Aivaaq in a fist fight with his friend James (John Miller); both are high on meth and Aivaaq loses control and accidentally kills James. Rather than report the matter to the police Aivaaq comes up with a plan to hide the body and let folks believe James has gone missing. Qalli agrees to help out of loyalty but soon his guilt over the cover up begins to take a heavy toll.

While water is arguably the world's most important natural resource shockingly little is being done to protect the global water supply and a number of leading scientists have produced evidence suggesting the amount of potable water is diminishing at an appalling rate (parts of the western United States and Australia are already becoming mired in drought). Issues such as irresponsible management permit massive amounts of water to go to waste and lax regulation of corporations has led to pollution that causes unexpected problems (for example one widely used herbicide present in many water supplies is causing frogs to change sex). Featuring a combination of expert interviews (including Erin Brockovich who talks at length about the real-life Hinkley CA pollution case that was adapted into the popular film that bears her name) comedy sketches (some featuring Jack Black) and cleverly edited montages Last Call at the Oasis also examines what can be done to help save our freshwater supplies before it's too late.

Even more remarkably police investigators determined that Vincent had been lying dead in her flat for close to three years with the lights on the television running and her unopened mail littering the floor. How did a seemingly healthy woman of 38 suddenly die in her apartment? More importantly how could Vincent have been missing for three years without friends or neighbors taking note of it? Filmmaker Carol Morley became fascinated with Vincent's story and began an investigation of her own.

Awareness of breast cancer has grown by leaps and bounds since the 1970s and the familiar pink ribbon has become a symbol of the struggle to find better treatment options and a cure for the disease. However while the many people who take part in high-profile fund-raising efforts such as the Susan G. Komen Walk for the Cure event are clearly sincere in their desire to help a growing number are questioning the way corporate influence and politics have become part of the campaign against breast cancer. The fight against breast cancer was once seen as a feminist issue but many have attempted to give the movement a "friendlier" more neutral image and a number of companies use the campaign as a way to hawk "pinkwashed" products some of which have negative health consequences. And as the breast cancer movement tries to send out a positive message of hope the rate of new cases keeps increasing and for all the money that's been raised the cause of the disease remains unknown. Filmmaker Léa Pool examines the history of breast cancer activism how a devastating illness became a marketing opportunity and how a small but vocal number of people are working to change the conversation about cancer in women in the documentary Pink Ribbons Inc.

Directed by Academy Award winner Vanessa Roth (The Third Monday in October) and produced by Dave Eggers (Away We Go) American Teacher aims to address the difficult questions about the broken public school system through honest dialogue with the people who strive to give our children a proper education. Every day Jamie Fidler Jonathan Dearman Erik Benner and Rhena Jasey each preside over a classroom full of children with unbound potential. But due to the fact that funds are in short supply and the hours can be grueling it's a constant uphill battle. Perhaps even more troubling is the revelation that over three million American teachers will be eligible for retirement in the next decade and that the current crop of college graduates are turning away from the profession in droves due to minuscule wages and a complete lack of prestige. Realizing that quality teachers are the key to a good education Roth profiles four educators who have devoted their careers to the betterment of today's youth but recognize that the entire system could collapse at any moment., Matt Damon, Waiting for "Superman" | I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary School | Hoop Dreams | The War on Kids | American Experience: Freedom Riders | Spellbound

Some researchers claim that since the 1950s Hollywood filmmakers and television producers have been barraging the general public with suggestive imagery that -- while often too subtle to be noticed by the naked eye -- may have the power to sway our opinions fuel bad habits and even alter the very foundation of our personalities. Others claim that the "War on Terror" itself -- with its convenient color-coded threat indicators -- is a sweeping subliminal campaign to ramp up paranoia and fear both at home in the U.S. and abroad. Even such rock & roll bands and musicians as Judas Priest and Led Zeppelin have stood accused of using backward masking in music to drive teens to suicide or to commit other reprehensible acts. Is there any truth to these bold sometimes shocking accusations?

Emily Blunt is Harriet Chetwode-Talbot a British businesswoman who manages the financial affairs of a wealthy but eccentric Arab named Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked). Muhammed's latest proposition involves paying fifty million pounds to fully stock a Yemeni river with salmon and thus engender sport fishing in the desert region. To better gauge the feasibility of this wild plan Harriet contacts Dr. Alfred "Fred" Jones (Ewan McGregor) a Scottish scientist who specializes in establishing fisheries. Jones shoots the plan down instantly but soon Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas) the press secretary to the British prime minister catches wind of it and sees it as the ideal way to promote better international relations between England and the Middle East especially in light of the torrent of bad news concerning terrorism and general unrest in the Arabic countries. She does everything she can to turn Jones around. Though the scientist will have no part of it at first he's threatened with job termination if he refuses and then sets out to create a fully stocked lake in the middle of the desert. As Jones takes on a project that ranks somewhere between ridiculous and impossible he also finds he's falling in love with Chetwode-Talbot though the fact that he's married and she has a boyfriend (Tom Mison) fighting in the Middle East makes things sticky.

Kennedy spoke out in favor of civil rights his administration had done little to practically remedy the situation. So a group of student activists stepped forward to force the issue of desegregation -- dozens of college students both black and white began traveling together by bus through the segregated South and simply by sitting together eating together and sharing motel rooms they raised controversy (often followed by violence) for flouting conventions that had been held for generations. The young civil rights activists became known as "Freedom Riders" and as their actions became national news they played a vital role in finally putting an end to Jim Crow laws in the South and eliminating the "separate but equal" doctrine. Filmmaker Stanley Nelson combines newsreel footage rare photos and new interviews with the activists who faced danger to fight prejudice in the documentary Freedom Riders which was an official selection at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival., , American Teacher | The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 | Sing Your Song | Magic Trip: Ken Kesey's Search for a Kool Place | An Ordinary Hero | Ride the Divide

The ride is tense and quiet at first but eventually the ice breaks and Ruben and Jacinta discover common ground as they share a few meaningful words; she's dealing with raising her daughter on her own and he struggles with the fact his work has made him almost a stranger to his own son. Ruben grows to appreciate Jacinta's unpretentious strength and good humor and when someone at a truck stop assumes they're a couple he begins to ponder what might have been and what could still be.

In 1926 as Mexican President Plutarcho Elias Calles found himself increasingly at odds with the nation's Catholic archdiocese he began enforcing a number of obscure anti-clerical laws and as Catholic churches were shuttered throughout Mexico peasants formed rebel groups called the Christeros to fight against government interference in expression of faith. By 1929 the Christero movement collapsed but a small number of rebels refused to give up their fight and in the late 1930s Col. Florencio Estrada (Alejandro Limon) still leads a tiny platoon of rebels who spend their days trying to outrun or outgun Federales determined to bring them in. Estrada's commitment to his beliefs outweighs the practicalities of the amnesty offered to surviving Christeros and even as a shortage of manpower and materiel makes the fight all the more difficult for them he and his men will not surrender even as they become aware of the futility of their cause. Director Matias Meyer cast Los Ultimos Cristeros (aka The Last Christeros) primarily with non-professional actors many of which are descendents of real-life Christeros rebels., Jesus Moises Rodriguez, Agora | Out of Africa | Friendly Persuasion | American Graffiti | Reds | Julius Caesar

Taken by the beauty and quaint charm of the village Rita decides to document Jotuomba with her homemade camera; she asks Madalena if she can rent a room and while Madalena agrees that doesn't mean she cares for Rita's presence or her often dismissive attitude towards the people living in the town she discovered.

In September 2008 Adrian Thomas walked into a Troy Newark police station to speak with detectives about the reason his four month old son Matthew was brain dead. Though Thomas waived his Miranda Rights at the time he had no idea that the exhausting 10 hour interview was being captured on video and that it would later be used as key evidence against him when the case went to court. At first Thomas denied any wrongdoing but after suffering a mental breakdown and being transferred to a psychiatric ward he was brought back for questioning. That's when his story began to change. But could it be that Thomas' confession was the result of unscrupulous police interrogation techniques? Though a doctor from the Albany Medical Center initially informed police that a fracture in Matthew's skull was an indication of abuse that was later retracted as a misdiagnosis. Even with that knowledge the police pressed on anyway ultimately getting Thomas to confess to throwing Matthew on the bed in a fit of frustration. In this film viewers are taken deep into a controversial case that shines an illuminating light on questionable police interrogation techniques that may have resulted in a tragic miscarriage of justice., , Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory | Paradise Lost 2: Revelations | The Thin Blue Line | Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills | The Treasure of the Sierra Madre | American Gangster

The Cubs made it to the National League playoffs and were leading the Florida Marlins 3 to 0 in the sixth game of the series. The Marlins were up three games but a win for the Cubs would have tied the series and put them one game away from a pennant victory for the first time in 48 years. However while left fielder Moises Alou was jumping to catch a foul ball in the eighth inning a fan in the stands Steve Bartman tried to catch it without seeing Alou and accidentally knocked the ball from his glove. The play threw the game into the Marlins favor and they gained a second wind scoring eight runs and walking away with the pennant. Bartman immediately became the most hated man in Chicago and was belittled for costing the Cubs the World Series even though a close look at the game reveals he was hardly the villain of the piece. Filmmaker Alex Gibney examines the facts and the legend behind Steve Bartman's infamous catch as well as the nature of sports fans who demand a scapegoat in the documentary Catching Hell which also explores a similarly embarrassing moment in the history of Gibney's favorite team the Boston Red Sox.

In the 1970s Russell became a full-fledged rock star sharing stages with the likes of George Harrison The Rolling Stones and Joe Cocker as well as releasing a handful of Top Ten albums that fused rock R&B and country. But Russell was musically inactive through much of the 1980s and when he returned his audience had dwindled to a tiny cult following and he depended on steady road gigs to stay afloat. In the 1970s Elton John was a serious fan of Russell's music and often cited him as an influence on his piano and songwriting style; in 2010 he felt it was time the world got reacquainted with Leon Russell's music. John approached Russell with the idea of making a collaborative album with T-Bone Burnett producing the project and the two very different men united by their love for music and respect for one another's talent got to work. Filmmaker and former rock critic Cameron Crowe was invited to document the creation of the album and The Union follows the process from the first songwriting sessions to the final recording sessions.

His wife Gina (Liv Ullmann) is an opposite personality type: subdued quiet not prone to excessive outbursts.
