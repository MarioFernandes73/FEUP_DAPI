Tolkien's classic to a close in suitably epic fashion. Instead of starting just where the previous film left off however it goes far back in time to the moment the tormented creature Gollum first came to possess the One Ring. In this flashback actor Andy Serkis (who voiced Gollum and performed his movements onset prior to the final CGI effects) finally gets to appear onscreen portraying Gollum's former self Sméagol. This disturbing scene serves as a potent reminder that the Ring seeks to corrupt even the well-intentioned Frodo (Elijah Wood) who is increasingly struggling with the dark power of the Ring himself. Thus the film returns to the present following Frodo Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum as they journey ever closer to the foreboding land of Mordor. They pass by the terrifying dark city of Minas Morgul watching as the dreadful army of the Witch King sets out for the human strongholds in Gondor and move on to the rocky stairs to Cirith Ungol where an even darker enemy lies in wait. Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship reunites in Rohan having defeated the wizard Saruman on two different fronts at Helm's Deep and Isengard. They are not together for long though since the hobbit Pippin (Billy Boyd) gets into trouble making it necessary for him and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to hastily depart for Minas Tirith capital of Gondor. Once there they find the steward of Gondor Denethor (John Noble) in an unstable mental state and the city preparing for battle against the amassing forces of Sauron. Denethor unwisely sends his only remaining son Faramir (David Wenham) back into bloody battle to prove himself. He returns nearly dead sending Denethor over the edge of sanity. In another realm elf Arwen (Liv Tyler) begins her journey to immortal life in the Grey Havens on her way to leave Middle-earth -- and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) -- forever but has a vision that causes her to once again reconsider her decision. Back in Rohan the men are preparing to ride to Gondor's aide. Éowyn (Miranda Otto) desperately wants to join the men in battle but her uncle King Théoden (Bernard Hill) orders her to stay and defend Rohan if necessary. The hobbit Merry (Dominic Monaghan) also desires to ride with the men but is denied due to his small size and inexperience. Aragorn is met there by the elf Elrond (Hugo Weaving) who brings him the re-forged Sword that was Broken (in the ancient battle with Sauron) and urges him to take a different route to Gondor. Heeding Elrond's advice Aragorn along with elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) takes a cavernous path through the mountains where they meet ghoulish ghosts who betrayed Aragorn's ancestors and are doomed to eternal unrest unless they fulfill their broken oaths by aiding him. All but Frodo Sam and Gollum will meet on the massive battlefield of the Pelennor before the gates of Minas Tirith. The former three instead engage in a battle of wills between each other and the One Ring as they head toward the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it. Released in December 2003 The Return of the King topped even its massively successful trilogy predecessors at the box office and went on to garner a whopping 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture -- winning in all the categories in which it was nominated and tying the record of total awards won with Ben-Hur and Titanic., Elijah Wood | Ian McKellen | Viggo Mortensen | Sean Astin | Orlando Bloom | Andy Serkis | Billy Boyd | Dominic Monaghan | John Rhys-Davies | Liv Tyler | Bernard Hill | Miranda Otto | Hugo Weaving | Cate Blanchett | David Wenham | Karl Urban | John Noble | Ian Holm | Joel Tobeck | Sean Bean, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers | The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring | Dragonheart | National Geographic: Beyond the Movie - The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King | Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith | The Lord of the Rings

Irving Steinbloom was one of the great behind-the-scenes figures of the folk music boom of the late '50s and early '60s and helped to nurture the careers of three of the best known acts of the era. The Folksmen -- Mark Shubb (Harry Shearer) Alan Barrows (Christopher Guest) and Jerry Palter (Michael McKean) -- were an earnest folk trio who sang of America's noble past and the challenges of the future; they split up in the early '70s after a failed attempt to go electric. Mitch & Mickey were a duo in both music and life comprised of Mitch Cohen (Eugene Levy) and Mickey Devlin (Catherine O'Hara). They sang soulful songs of love until the collapse of their relationship sent Mitch into a deep and incapacitating depression. And The Main Street Singers were a nine-piece vocal group -- a "neuftet" as they prefer it -- who offered energetic good-time music cranking out nearly 30 albums in the course of a decade; their current incarnation The New Main Street Singers (played by Jane Lynch Parker Posey John Michael Higgins David Alan Blasucci Steve Pandis Christopher Moynihan Paul Dooley and Patrick Sauber) is still on the road. When it is announced that the legendary Irving Steinbloom has died (the character never appears in the film) his son Jonathan (Bob Balaban) decides that the best way to memorialize his father is through music and with the help of Mike LaFontaine (Fred Willard) of Hi-Class Management they set out to bring The Folksmen Mitch & Mickey and The New Main Street Singers back together for a special concert at New York's Town Hall. Christopher Guest Michael McKean and Harry Shearer -- who previously teamed up for This Is Spinal Tap -- not only perform together as The Folksmen in A Mighty Wind but composed most of the songs performed onscreen., Bob Balaban | Christopher Guest | Catherine O'Hara | Eugene Levy | Michael McKean | Jane Lynch | John Michael Higgins | Parker Posey | Harry Shearer | Fred Willard | Ed Begley Jr. | Paul Dooley | Jennifer Coolidge | Michael Hitchcock | Don Lake | Larry Miller | Deborah Theaker | Christopher Moynihan | Linda Kash | Jim Piddock | Laura Harris | David Blasucci | Paul Benedict, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story | Waiting for Guffman | The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch | Best in Show | Sons of Provo | Forgotten Silver

The Weathermen were a faction of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) one of the driving forces behind the period's mass protests against social injustice and the Vietnam War. Frustrated by SDS's adherence to non-violent dissent the Weathermen broke off and adopted a more combative approach. As the student protests ebbed in the 1970s the group went underground and shifted tactics embarking on a terrorist campaign against the U.S. government.

They were experienced climbers and climbed "Alpine-style" climbing the mountain in "one great push" without setting up ropes or base camps ahead of time. After dealing with a snowstorm and some dangerous climbing over powder formations they reached the summit (about 21000 feet) on the third day. The climb down proved to be far more difficult. Simpson fell and broke his leg badly. Yates decided to try to lower Simpson down the mountain one 300-foot section of rope at a time. The climbers had run out of gas to melt snow so they couldn't risk stopping as night came and a violent snowstorm began. Their plodding painful journey hit a snag when Yates inadvertently lowered Simpson over the edge of a cliff. In the storm the men couldn't hear each other's cries and Yates uncertain as to Simpson's position and gradually sliding down the slope himself decided to cut the rope that connected them sending Simpson plummeting to certain death. Miraculously Simpson survived the fall and was faced with the prospect of getting off the mountain alone with no food no water and a broken leg. In Touching the Void filmmaker Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September) tells their story based on Simpson's book using contemporary interviews with the two men and a reenactment of their climb and descent featuring Brendan Mackey as Simpson and Nicholas Aaron as Yates.

A mother is separated from her very young children. Young Palestinians laugh and throw snowballs at Israeli soldiers who jovially respond in kind. One Israeli soldier harasses a pretty Palestinian girl. Another refers to the Arabs as "animals" and suggests the documentary crew is making a film for the Discovery Channel. Palestinians wait in the pouring rain while an Israeli soldier eats his lunch. Another young soldier gets into a prolonged argument with a Palestinian man because he'd told the man an hour earlier that he would be able to cross back over the checkpoint to return home and now a curfew is in effect. After his superior reluctantly lets the man through the embarrassed soldier turns to the filmmaker and pleads "Try to make me look good...not like the bad guy." Language barriers constantly interfere with the soldiers' ability to do their jobs. "It's not my decision" is a constant refrain as they turn people away. Israeli filmmaker Yoav Shamir once served his army reserve duty as a checkpoint guard which was what inspired him to make this documentary Checkpoint. For 80 minutes Shamir simply shows us videotape of what happens at the various checkpoints that the Israeli government operates which are in place to regulate the travel of Palestinians purportedly in an effort to combat terrorism. The documentary uses no narration and the soldiers and Palestinians at the checkpoints are never identified. The subtitles simply tell the audience where the checkpoint being videotaped is located.

Twelve years after the first film was made Wuornos was still in contact with Broomfield from her cell on death row and he was called as a witness in her final death penalty appeal before the state. Clips of the earlier film were used by defense lawyers to help make the case that Wuornos' lawyer during sentencing Steven Glaser was incompetent. Footage used in court shows Glaser smoking pot on his way to the prison to confer with his client. Broomfield uses the opportunity to interview Wuornos several more times and to examine the horrific details of her childhood interviewing her acquaintances and surviving members of her family. While making the new film Broomfield learns that Wuornos increasingly unstable and paranoid is unwilling to continue to fight for her life. Desperate to escape death row she has abandoned her convincing claim that she committed murder in self-defense and she now wants to be executed as soon as possible. In Jeb Bush's Florida it's clear this isn't difficult to accomplish. Broomfield talks to the mentally deteriorated Wuornos one last time before her execution.

They then begin doing some strange renovations. It turns out that they're not a couple at all. They're members of the Red Brigade and the apartment is going to be used to house a kidnapped government official. Good Morning Night is established writer/director Marco Bellocchio's take on the kidnapping of Aldo Moro president of the Christian Democratic Party which rocked Italian politics in the late '70s. Bellocchio tells the story from Chiara's point-of-view as her romantic relationship with fellow cell member Primo (Giovanni Calcagno) and her allegiance to their strident leader Mariano (Luigi Lo Cascio) is gradually shaken as she begins to develop respect and affection for their hapless captive Moro (Roberto Herlitzka). She also begins to feel attracted to Enzo (Paolo Briguglia) a co-worker at her office job (a front for her more radical activities) who has similar political leanings but strongly disagrees with the Red Brigade's tactics. Chiara spends hours watching Moro in his "cell" through a peephole as he defends his political actions in a mock trial conducted by Mariano. As negotiations for Moro's release falter due to the government's hard-line stance Chiara begins to fantasize about helping him escape.

Here Bergman revisits the two characters from that film divorcees Johan (Erland Josephson) and Marianne (Liv Ullmann) after years of estrangement from one another. Marianne now lives alone; of her two middle-aged daughters from the marriage to Johan one lives in Australia while the other suffered a mental breakdown. Marianne has contact with neither.

The relationships in Johan's family are broken and deeply dysfunctional: Johan resents Henrik whom he perceives as worthless in every capacity other than fatherhood; Henrik resents Johan for his niggardly attitudes about his wealth; Karin feels bound by familial shackles and yearns to escape the confines of the life that ensnares her ultimately hoping to move to the city and pursue her dream of becoming a cellist.

With this in mind Walker (then only 22 years old) and Eaton (whose family owned one of Canada's most successful department store chains) signed up Janis Joplin the Grateful Dead the Band Buddy Guy the Flying Burrito Brothers and several others and hired out a private train that would carry the musicians in high style for a string of five shows from Toronto to Calgary. The jaunt was called "The Festival Express" and a camera crew tagged along to capture the shows on film as well as the constant party that took place en route. The tour proved to be a financial bust and as a result the footage sat on the shelf for over thirty years until director Bob Smeaton recut the material into Festival Express which not only documents the glorious folly of the tour but offers a hindsight look at the events from some of the surviving participants., Janis Joplin, Shine a Light | John Mellencamp: It's About You | Magic Trip: Ken Kesey's Search for a Kool Place | The Last Waltz | Woodstock | Lightning in a Bottle

Taking the form of a BBC documentary about slavery in America C.S.A. traces the history of the Confederate States of America beginning in 1863 as the Southern States turned the tide in the War of Northern Aggression when with the help of British and French troops they won a decisive victory at the Battle of Gettysburg. Two years later Ulysses S. Grant surrendered to Robert E. Lee as the Confederacy emerged victorious against the United States of America. As Abraham Lincoln and many other supporters of the Abolitionist cause fled to Canada the Northern States were gradually absorbed into the Confederacy and the right to own slaves became the uncontested law of the land. Over the course of the next 150 years the Confederate States of America grew to become the most powerful nation on Earth and persevered through wars in Spain and Latin America that expanded Confederate territories and stood tall against Japan thanks to an alliance with German leader Adolf Hitler. In the present day the Confederate States of America remain a power to be reckoned with despite foreign pressures to eliminate the slavery programs that are the economic backbone of the country a long simmering "cold war" with Canada and the ongoing conflict against the Muslim Menace.

While the Warhols self-described as the "most well-adjusted band in America" sold a lot of records in Europe before achieving commercial success in the U.S. the Brian Jonestown Massacre led by the mercurial Anton Newcombe self-destructed in an orgy of drug abuse and internal squabbling. Timoner followed the groups' fortunes for about seven years. In the late '90s the groups met and Taylor forged a friendship with Newcombe whom he greatly admired. The bands often played together and while BJM were being courted for a seemingly surefire major label deal the Warhols signed with Capitol. As Timoner documents the record deal and its attendant perks marked the beginning of a rift between the bands as BJM members seemed to resent the Warhols' success while the Warhols seemed all too willing to rely on their association with their out-of-control counterparts in BJM to gain a certain punk credibility. Timoner focuses more heavily on the antics of Newcombe and his band capturing a spectacular meltdown at an industry showcase a poorly planned tour that finds the band playing a ten-hour show for an audience of around ten people and an embarrassing drug bust on the road. Eventually the division between the former friends reaches the point where BJM puts out a record attacking the Warhols and Newcombe struggling with a life-threatening drug problem begins stalking them at their shows either in a misguided attempt to gain publicity or with sincere ill will.

However what happened after that soon became something of a tempest in a teapot -- spectator Patrick Hayashi walked away with the record-setting ball but fellow fan Alex Popov claimed that he caught the ball but it was wrestled away from him when dozens of folks were reaching for it at once. In time Papov went so far as to take the matter to court...not as silly as it might sound when one considers that some sports memorabilia dealers estimated its value at one million dollars. Up for Grabs is a witty documentary from first-time director Michael Wranovics that examines the war of words and later court case between Hayashi and Popov as different observers recall the big moment in very different ways., , Catching Hell | Fastpitch | Still We Believe: The Boston Red Sox Movie | A League of Ordinary Gentlemen | Slasher | American Movie

In the 1950s and '60s bowling was one of America's most popular sports with millions spending their spare time on the lanes and watching professional bowling on television. However the game's popularity took a nosedive in the 1980s and '90s and matters only got worse when network television dropped regular bowling coverage. Eventually the Professional Bowlers Association was bought out by a group of Microsoft executives who pumped five million dollars into the organization and hired former football player Steve Miller to give the game a PR makeover in hopes of attracting a new audience. In A League of Ordinary Gentlemen documentary filmmaker Chris Browne follows four professional bowlers -- Pete Weber Walter Ray Williams Jr. Chris Barnes and Wayne Webb -- as they scrape out a living on the pro bowling circuit and try to make sense of Miller's attempts to give the game a higher profile with the solid play of Williams who has won the PBA championship a whopping 39 times often overlooked in favor of the "bad boy" showboating of Webber., , Bowling for the Mob | Dreamer | Still We Believe: The Boston Red Sox Movie | Up for Grabs | Huutajat | Word Wars

The rapid expansion of the hypermarket phenomenon in their homeland inspired young filmmakers Vít Klusák and Filip Remunda to use state-of-the-art marketing techniques to wage a massive promotional campaign for their own hypermarket which they would call "Czech Dream." The major difference between Czech Dream and its competitors was that the Czech Dream hypermarket existed only in Klusák and Remunda's imaginations. And so perhaps the most elaborate prank in the history of documentary filmmaking began. First Klusák and Remunda hired image consultants ditching their shabby student appearances for something slick corporate and upbeat. Newly yuppified the filmmakers hired the advertising agency Mark BBDO to help them sell their fraud to the public. An ingeniously forthright ad campaign plastered on bus kiosks and billboards throughout Prague warns potential shoppers "Don't come...don't rush...don't spend." A schmaltzy jingle plays on the radio and television ads are placed. The nonexistent market's location is withheld from the public until just before opening day when a huge crowd gathers in a meadow outside the city where behind a colorful facade lies...nothing. Czech Dream was shown at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival where it was introduced by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock (Super Size Me)., , Sicko | Choke | Super Size Me | The Yes Men | The Fortune Cookie | Slasher

Carri is no stranger to experimental techniques -- her short film Barbie Can Be Sad Too was narrated entirely by dolls -- and Los Rubios is equally unconventional. Though the film starts off with a fairly cut-and-dried depiction of the investigation surrounding the 1977 disappearance of a group of political militants (a group which included Carri's parents) it isn't long before abstract metaphors begin their takeover: footage of real-life interviews with friends and neighbors is shown alongside a fantasy sequence involving a plastic spaceship hurtling toward a pair of plastic toys that Carri chose to represent two parental figures.

Chayes was an accomplished reporter for National Public Radio who found herself wanting to do more than just report. Disenchanted by the American media's biased coverage of the war in Afghanistan (including a CNN edict not to air footage of civilian casualties) Chayes felt like there were tremendous limits on how much impact she could have "as a single reporter." After interviewing the uncle of Afghan President Hamid Karzai Chayes was shocked when he asked her bluntly "Won't you come back to help us?" She decided to quit her job and go to work for Afghans for a Civil Society a nonprofit group run by the president's brother Quyam Karzai. Her first meeting with the president is nearly aborted after he survives an assassination attempt. Eventually she takes charge of an operation to rebuild Akokolacha a small town near Kandahar that was destroyed by American bombs. Knappenberger's documentary shows the trials and triumphs of Chayes' effort. The town agrees to supply its own workers but no one shows up on the first day. The elderly man chosen as the first to have his house rebuilt is unhappy with its proposed dimensions. A scheming warlord with a lucrative American contract to rebuild the local road disrupts Chayes' efforts to obtain stone for the foundations of the houses.

A passionate enthusiast of classical vocal music Hockney's interest in opera has helped to transform the visual aspect of how the pieces are presented from his bright use of color to his insistence on making lighting cues an integral part of his design. However there's also an irony to Hockney's success in opera -- at the age of 67 Hockney began losing a significant amount of his hearing which would not only impact his ability to create for a medium that has earned him so much acclaim but rob him of his ability to appreciate the music that means so much to him.

The United States who had backed Somoza was unhappy with this turn of events and attempted to unseat the Sandinistas by giving financial and military support to the Contras (right-wing guerillas loyal to Somoza) largely through illicit means. The media took it upon themselves to put Nicaragua's trials in the spotlight and in 1987 the documentary The World Is Watching examined how the international attention given to the story by the media impacted the battle between the Sandinistas and the Contras as well as offered the perspectives of the reporters covering these events. At the dawn of the 21st Century however press coverage of Nicaragua had all but vanished while the nation's problems continued to grow in the face of dire poverty poor education disease and continued unrest. The World Stopped Watching picks up where the earlier film left off as filmmaker Peter Raymont and his crew travel to Nicaragua to explore what became of the nation's revolution how the people feel about the struggle of Right versus Left (and Ronald Reagan's role in the conflict) over 15 years later and speak with those who witnessed the turmoil first hand.

In October 2002 simmering tensions reached the boiling point when Lewiston mayor Larry Raymond published an open letter in which he stated that Lewiston's city services were being stretched to the breaking point and as a consequence no more Somalis should move into the town. A number of acts of violence against the new Somali visitors followed and in 2003 a group of white supremacists led by the neo-Nazi sect the World Church of the Creator announced their intention to stage a massive rally in Lewiston in which they would demand the Somalis leave the community. In response some of the people of Lewiston began organizing an alternative rally to show their support for their new neighbors.

Its star player that year was a young triple-threat man and home-run impresario named George Herman "Babe" Ruth.

Faced with enormous debts after backing a failed Broadway musical team owner Harry Frazee was in desperate need of quick money. His solution: to trade the Babe to the New York Yankees. Ever since that dreaded day the Red Sox have endured nothing but headaches heartbreaks and not one single solitary Series win. Can it be that a curse has been leveled upon the team thanks to Frazee's improvidence -- The Curse of the Bambino? In this amusing but heartfelt HBO documentary narrated by actor Ben Affleck archival footage and contemporary interviews are woven together to illustrate the plight of the benighted modern-day Sox fan -- and the Herculean efforts made to "break" the curse among them an ongoing effort to recover a battered piano that according to legend Babe Ruthdumped into a Boston pond back in the 1920s. The interviewees rabid Sox addicts all range from a Beantown rabbi to actor/comedian Denis Leary.

Mitch (Luke Wilson) returns home from a less-than-pleasant business trip one evening to discover his wife Heidi (Juliette Lewis) involved in a ménage à trois with two blindfolded strangers. Feeling less than welcome at home after this Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college; two of Mitch's old college buddies Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell) stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at Mitch's place despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa (Perrey Reeves) while Beanie and his wife Lara (Leah Remini) are busy with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living he's able to trick out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the school's leading party spot which raises the ire of Pritchard (Jeremy Piven) a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch Frank and Beanie's abuse when they were all students. Pritchard arranges to have Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district but Beanie and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their headquarters. Mitch however is not enthusiastic about the idea especially as he's trying to impress Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) a beautiful divorcee who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's "party hearty" lifestyle. Old School director Todd Phillips knows more than a bit about the seamy side of fraternity life as director of the infamous unreleased documentary Frat House., Luke Wilson | Will Ferrell | Vince Vaughn | Jeremy Piven | Ellen Pompeo | Juliette Lewis | Leah Remini | Perrey Reeves | Craig Kilborn | Elisha Cuthbert | Jerod Mixon | Seann William Scott | Harve Presnell | James Carville | Snoop Dogg | Warren G. | Andy Dick | Artie Lange | Matthew Carey | Sara Tanaka | Patrick J.

https://www.allmovie.com/movie/easy-riders-raging-bulls-v281374, Easy Riders Raging Bulls, Film TV & Radio, Film & Television History, , 119, UK USA, NR, 7, , Kenneth Bowser, Freemantle Corporation Submarine Entertainment, TRIO, , Filmmaking | Rise and Fall Stories, filmmaker behind-the-scenes commercialism creativity history Hollywood marketing, , Based upon Peter Biskind's book of the same name this BBC-produced documentary traces the rise of a generation of Hollywood filmmakers who briefly changed the face of movies with a more personal approach that pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable onscreen. Influenced by such European directors as Jean-Luc Godard François Truffaut and Federico Fellini the movement kicked off in the mid-'60s with two films directed by Arthur Penn: Mickey One and Bonnie and Clyde. (The latter had been offered to both Godard and Truffaut before it wound up with producer/star Warren Beatty and Penn.) What really kicked it into gear was the unexpected success of Easy Rider a biker-road movie that became that rare film phenomenon: acclaimed at the Cannes Film Festival and a huge commercial success. Film school graduates the first generation brought up with movies as their main cultural reference flooded the studios (whose own regimes were changing) with production chieftains such as Robert Evans of Paramount and David Picker at United Artists; they approved risky-looking projects and allowed relatively untested filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola to take on heavyweight movies such as The Godfather or Hollywood newcomers like Britain's John Schlesinger to make quirky stories like Midnight Cowboy. Enriched by success with their TV show The Monkees producer Bert Schneider and director Bob Rafelson formed a company that produced not only Easy Rider but seminal '70s films such as Five Easy Pieces and the Oscar-winning Vietnam War documentary Hearts and Minds. Another godfather to the new movement was producer Roger Corman who gave early career opportunities to Coppola Martin Scorsese Peter Bogdanovich and Jonathan Demme on low-budget projects that allowed them to learn their craft. Two things brought this movement to an end: Some individual filmmakers' personal excesses (such disastrous flops as Dennis Hopper's follow-up to Easy Rider appropriately titled The Last Movie and Scorsese's New York New York) and the studios growing fascination with special effects-driven B-movies. An outgrowth of two box-office and marketing juggernauts -- Jaws and Star Wars -- the resulting films became entertainments rather than personal statements of the directors. Narrated by William H. Macy Easy Riders Raging Bulls features vintage clips of Coppola Scorsese Beatty George Lucas Sam Peckinpah Roman Polanski Robert Altman and Pauline Kael. It also includes original interview material with Penn; Corman; Bogdanovich; Hopper; Picker; writer/directors John Milius and Paul Schrader; actresses Karen Black Cybill Shepherd Margot Kidder and Jennifer Salt (the latter two shared a house in Malibu a social center for young filmmakers); actors Peter Fonda Kris Kristofferson and Richard Dreyfuss; producers Jerome Hellman Michael Phillips and Jonathan Taplin; editor Dede Allen; production designer Polly Platt; writers David Newman Joan Tewksbury Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck; cinematographers Laszlo Kovacs and Vilmos Zsigmond; agent Mike Medavoy; and former production executive Peter Bart.

This documentary portrait features extensive archival footage of MacGowan's career inspired by the twin poles of traditional Irish music and the raging punk scene of the late '70s (he credits John Lydon of the Sex Pistols and that band's anti-British sentiments as a major influence). We see videos of his early band the Nips (short for the Nipple Erectors); performance footage of the Pogues; clips from studio sessions with Elvis Costello who produced the band's acclaimed Rum Sodomy and the Lash (and married the band's bass player Caitlin O'Riordan); a TV appearance with Sinead O'Connor who publicly criticized MacGowan's drinking rousing his ire; and the video for the band's justly famous Christmas song "Fairytale of New York" with Kirsty MacColl. There are interviews with MacGowan's parents who speak candidly of their son's difficult childhood growing up in an urban slum in England where the family had moved to find employment; his wife Victoria Clarke; colleagues Philip Gaston Deirdre Mahoney Nick Cave and Liam Clancy; and bandmates who discuss the decision to sack their front man in 1990. Recent footage finds MacGowan a striking figure of decrepitude -- most of his front teeth are missing and he is never far from a drink and a cigarette -- who also manages to maintain a certain air of besotted dignity. The film opens with a 2000 Christmas Eve performance in Dublin by MacGowan's band the Popes; MacGowan mumbles his way through one of his songs but the audience ably offers vocal support., Nick Cave, End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones | Sonic Youth: 1991 - The Year Punk Broke | Khachaturian | Paul Williams Still Alive | The Devil and Daniel Johnston | Imagine: John Lennon - The Definitive Film Portrait

As a young woman the deeply troubled Spielrein left Russia for Zurich and eventually crossed paths with Carl Jung becoming his first analysis patient at his famous Burgholzli clinic. Jung diagnosed and successfully treated her for hysteria prompting the young Russian to go into medicine and eventually practice psychology as one of the first female members of Sigmund Freud's Psychoanalytical Society. Remaining in close contact with both of her mentors for a large portion of her life Spielrein's influence on both men's psychoanalytical theories was relatively unknown until the aforementioned discovery of her letters and diaries.

Going back to an early 1990 concert by the now-defunct band the Stone Roses Dower traces the roots of the Brit-pop movement as originating from Britain's simultaneously discontented and disenfranchised youth a residual outcome of the Conservative Party's decade-long stranglehold on Britain's political and cultural identity. As Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher departed from her office the 1990 Roses concert seemed to indicate a new musical movement would soon follow. Within a couple of years the rock groups Blur and Oasis would take the lead in the new anti-establishment almost anti-American style of music that briefly seemed to revitalize Britain's sense of musical identity.

Wilson's self-released album sank like a stone but with the passage of time it developed a cult following among fans of musical arcadia (most notably Beck who even name-checked Wilson in one of his tunes) and in 2002 the independent record label Motel Records became interested in re-issuing You Think You Really Know Me; however by that time Wilson had been out of the music business for years and no one was sure what became of him. You Think You Really Know Me: The Gary Wilson Movie is a documentary which follows the search for Gary Wilson tracing his story from his days as a teenage misfit to his rediscovery while working in a porn bookstore in California to his return to the stage following the rerelease of his album., , The Devil and Daniel Johnston | Searching for Sugar Man | Paul Williams Still Alive | Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King | Jandek on Corwood | A League of Ordinary Gentlemen

Its name a grim irony the Belgian Free State gave Leopold and his cohorts power over the African territory of the Congo which he soon exploited for its large supplies of ivory and rubber -- the latter an especially lucrative resource after the invention of the pneumatic tire. Leopold and his soldiers used the Congolese natives as forced labor with those who refused to work for the Belgians or who violated their newly established laws punished by dismemberment torture or death; between 1885 and 1920 nearly ten million people were either slaughtered or worked to death in the Congo under Leopold's rule. Leopold's reign of terror in the Congo became a scandal during the last years of his rule and he destroyed most of the documents pertaining to the Belgian Free State prior to his death; Congo: White King Red Rubber Black Death is a film which attempts to examine the king's crimes with the evidence that still remains. Using interviews with historians rare documents and historical reenactments of Leopold's atrocities Congo: White King Red Rubber Black Death is framed by footage of an imagined trial with the king facing a jury for his crimes against humanity -- crimes he was never charged with in his lifetime., Nick Fraser, The Empire in Africa | Banished: How Whites Drove Blacks Out of Town in America | The Ku Klux Klan: A Secret History | The China Syndrome | No End in Sight | 4 Little Girls

Stevens was on location shooting a movie and Bingenheimer says he didn't see his mother again for five or six years after that. The Mayor of the Sunset Strip a documentary by George Hickenlooper (Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse) tracks Bingenheimer's rise from the 1960s when he was a groupie -- eventually landing his first show-business job as a double for Davy Jones on The Monkees -- through stints as a successful club owner and influential DJ to his current status as a fading musical icon. The film takes us from the innocent pop of Brian Wilson and Sonny & Cher through the raucous heyday of L.A.'s punk scene and beyond. Hickenlooper also delves into Bingenheimer's relationships showing him mourning his neglectful and unbalanced but beloved mother and visiting with his father who never attempted to make contact with Bingenheimer after his mother abandoned him.

As American attitudes continued to evolve so did the American film industry; as costly big-budget blockbusters nearly brought the major studios to the brink of collapse smaller and more personal films such as Bonnie and Clyde Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces demonstrated there was a ready audience for bold and challenging entertainment. As the '60s faded into the 1970s American cinema moved into an exciting period of creativity and stylistic innovation which led to such landmark films as The Godfather MASH The Last Picture Show Shampoo One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Chinatown and Taxi Driver and new freedom for directors and screenwriters. Ironically however it was another pair of big-budget blockbusters directed by students of the new wave of filmmaking -- Jaws and Star Wars -- which brought the studios back to power and put an end to Hollywood's flirtation with offbeat creativity. A Decade Under the Influence is a documentary which explores the rise and fall of new American filmmaking in the 1970s and features interviews with many of the key directors screenwriters and actors whose work typified the movement including Francis Ford Coppola Robert Altman Martin Scorsese Paul Schrader Roger Corman Dennis Hopper Jon Voight and Julie Christie. A Decade Under the Influence received its world premier at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and an expanded version of the film was later shown on the premium cable outlet The Independent Film Channel; the documentary was the final work of co-director Ted Demme who died shortly before the film was completed., Martin Scorsese | Francis Ford Coppola | Robert Altman | Peter Bogdanovich | Ellen Burstyn | Julie Christie | Dennis Hopper | Sidney Lumet | Milos Forman | Robert Towne | Sydney Pollack | Paul Schrader | Pam Grier | William Friedkin | Bruce Dern | Roger Corman | Mike Medavoy | Polly Platt | Jerry Schatzberg | Roy Scheider | Jon Voight | Paul Mazursky | John Calley | John G.

Resisting Paradise puts its primary focus on two artists who lived in the South of France and were strongly influenced by its beauty and light -- the fauvist master Henri Matisse and contemporary success Pierre Bonnard. In interviews Bonnard views art as an essentially apolitical pursuit and regards war and governmental corruption as matters not worthy of his attention. However Matisse felt differently as both the artist and his family were active members of the French Resistance during World War II taking their lives in their hands to combat fascism in Europe. Hammer also interviews other figures who confronted the Nazi threat during the war and offers her own views on creative people who stand by as evil manifests itself.

K. Film Council, Optimum Releasing, , , prison, , Brian Keenan from Belfast was in Beirut teaching English in 1986 when he was taken hostage by the Islamic Jihad. Blind Flight tells the story of his imprisonment. After his abduction Keenan (played by Ian Hart) is held alone in a tiny dark cell for a long time. He's ordered to cover his eyes whenever his captors enter the room. Eventually he is moved to a new location where he has a cellmate British journalist John McCarthy (played by Linus Roache) who had filed a story on Keenan's abduction just before being kidnapped himself. The two warm to each other gradually and have different approaches to surviving their shared ordeal. Keenan relishes his righteous anger repeatedly proclaiming his innocence and using tactics like a hunger strike and refusing to wear the clean clothes he's given in order to maintain his sense of himself. McCarthy is more docile and tries to obey whatever commands are given. As the two get to know each other the brittle angry Keenan surprises McCarthy with the revelation that while he has an Irish Republican passport (and seems to hate the British as much as his captors do) he's actually Protestant. The upper-class McCarthy reveals that his father was Irish. Eventually the two form a strong bond. Their captors show occasional glimmers of kindness but more often the two men face cruelty and deprivation heightened by the fact that they have no idea if they will ever be released. Blind Flight was directed by John Furse from a script by Furse and Keenan based on Keenan and McCarthy's published memoirs.

In 1978 an album called Ready for the House appeared credited to "The Units" and released by Corwood Industries a nascent label out of Houston TX; a collection of spare haunting songs dominated by atonal acoustic guitar and murmured (or mumbled) vocals Ready for the House received cautiously enthusiastic reviews by the very few writers who bothered to cover it and the same artist now billing himself as Jandek (a San Francisco synth-pop group was using the name the Units) released a second album Six and Six in 1981. By 2004 Jandek had issued 38 albums all following the same pattern -- a front cover featuring either a grainy photo of a tall thin man with blonde hair or obscure snapshots of houses empty rooms or street scenes; a back cover that was all back type on a white surface; music that was simple obscure and harrowingly personal; no information on the artist; and distribution that suggested the albums weren't released so much as tossed to the winds to see what might happen. Almost in spite of himself Jandek became the center of a small but fervent cult following despite the fact he receives almost no radio play doesn't tour has made only one known live appearance (unidentified and unannounced) doesn't promote his releases and refuses to talk to the media or even publicly acknowledge his identity (the man has given all of two interviews both under difficult circumstances). Filmmaker and Jandek enthusiast Chad Friedrich's documentary Jandek on Corwood examines the enigma that is Jandek and takes a long look at both his music and what this artist's purposefully obscure approach to his work says about him and his audience.

In truth there is little in this film that was not already common knowledge when it first aired on May 12 2003 but it's still fun to see a cast of attractive actors portraying another cast of attractive actors. In case anyone needs reminding Three's Company was the popular tickle-and-tease comedy series based upon the British Man About the House in which a virile young heterosexual man was forced to pose as a homosexual so that he could remain the roommate of two sexy young ladies. It was perhaps the quintessential "jiggle" sitcom thanks primarily to its well-endowed co-star Suzanne Somers (here played by Judy Tylor). Because of its risqué (but basically inoffensive) content Three's Company was turned down by both NBC and CBS before ambitious ABC CEO Fred Silverman (played by Brian Dennehy) decided to take a chance on the property. The rest as they say is history with Three's Company not only setting ratings records but also establishing a whole new threshold for what was and wasn't acceptable in network prime time. Inevitably the show collapsed under its own weight especially after the revolving-door cast changes which followed in the wake of the acrimonious defection of Suzanne Somers but it was fun while it lasted. For the record the other Three's Company stars were the multi-talented John Ritter (played by Bret Anthony) and the underrated Joyce DeWitt (Melanie Deane-Moore). The actual Joyce DeWitt also appears as herself in this movie serving as narrator and sidelines commentator. Though the film often pulls its punches regarding the original series' backstage intrigues and legal entanglements there is enough authentic detail remaining to satisfy the casual sitcom buff. Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Three's Company was filmed under the title Three's Company Revisited., Joyce DeWitt | Brian Dennehy | Bret Anthony | Judy Tylor | Daniel Roebuck | Michael Simms | Wallace Langham | Christopher Shyer | Jason Schombing | David Lewis | Gregg Binkley | Terence Kelly | Barbara Gordon | Gary Hudson | Fred Ewanuick | John Bluethner | Frank Adamson | Anne Ross | Ernesto Griffith | Greg Rogers | Matt Kippen | Marina Stephenson-Kerr | Tom Anniko | Yorick Parke | Ingrid Torrance | Colin Cunningham, Growing Up Brady | When Billie Beat Bobby | The Mogul | Funny Girl | Bonnie and Clyde | All About Eve

The place: The sleepy town of Jasper TX. Three young self-styled white supremists overpower a 49-year-old black man named James Byrd Jr. chain him to the back of their pickup and literally drag him to death. What follows is a media firestorm exacerbated by scores of network and cable-TV news services the grim pronouncements of so-called pundits and the intrusion upon Jasper of several extremist activists ranging from members of the Ku Klux Klan to the newly formed Black Panthers. As the frenzy continues the heretofore peaceful if somewhat tenuous relationship between the white and black residents of Jasper is severely strained with echoes of past racism resounding throughout the area. In the center of the controversy are two decent hard-working public servants: R.C. Horn the first black mayor of Jasper and Billy Rowles the town's white sheriff. Also profoundly affected by the appalling murder of Byrd are the respective parents of the victim and the killers. Happily when the dust clears justice is done (two of the murderers are condemned to death the third sentenced to life imprisonment) and instead of being wrenched apart the black and white communities of Jasper draw closer together than they have ever been. Made for cable TV this feature-length reenactment stars Louis Gossett Jr. as Horn and Jon Voight as Rowles. Although certain liberties are taken (the actor playing Byrd is clearly much younger than his real-life counterpart and the Black Panthers and KKK are incorrectly shown descending upon Jasper the same day) the film is by and large accurate. Better still there is a minimum of preaching and proselytizing. Previewed at the Philadelphia Film Festival Jasper Texas was given its official Showtime network cable premiere on June 8 2003 -- almost five years to the day after Byrd's death., Jon Voight | Joe Morton | Emily Yancy | Bokeem Woodbine | Blu Mankuma | Karen Robinson | Michelle Moffatt | Ron White | Eugene Clark | Dvora Kedar | Jim Millington | Kevin Hanchard | William Taylor | Victoria Snow | Toby Proctor | Jeff Topping | Andre Mayers | Wayne "Crescendo" Ward | Travis Davis | David Eisner | Samantha Bee | Dave Nichols | Kate Trotter | Ray Kahnert | Gary Hudson | Bill Lake | Michael Copeman | Neil Crone | Martin Doyle | Dean McKenzie | Eric Peterson | Richard Mills | Holly Lewis | Michael Ferguson | Conrad Bergschneider | Ron Payne | Jim Bearden | John Bayliss | Addison Bell | Sandra Caldwell | Craig Eldridge, To Kill a Mockingbird | The Klansman | Rosewood | A Time to Kill | Ghosts of Mississippi | The Grapes of Wrath

Perry and Keough quickly track down two likely suspects Orchard (Kurupt) and Sidwell (Dash Mihok) but Perry is surprised when the head of SIS Van Meter (Brendan Gleeson) tells him to let Orchard and Sidwell go and instead points the finger at two ex-cons who should be taken off the street even though they're innocent of this crime. Perry follows Van Meter's orders despite Keough's misgivings but in the wake of the L.A. riots Perry has a change of heart and decides to start working with Holland against Van Meter's corrupt methods.

That same year tragedy introduced itself into her life as Plath was forced to confront the unexpected death of her father. In 1950 she began studying at Smith College on a literary scholarship and while she was an outstanding student she also began suffering from bouts of extreme depression; following her junior year she attempted suicide for the first time. Plath survived and in 1955 she was granted a Fulbright Scholarship to study in England at Cambridge. While in Great Britain Plath met Ted Hughes (Daniel Craig) a respected author who would later become the British Poet Laureate; the two fell in love and married in 1958. However marriage family and a growing reputation as an important poet failed to bring Plath happiness and as she became increasingly fascinated with death in her later poetry and her sole novel The Bell Jar and after Hughes left her for another woman her depression went into a tailspin from which she would never fully recover. Sylvia was adapted in part from Birthday Letters a collection of poems Ted Hughes published in 1998 in which he dealt with his marriage to Plath in print for the first time., Gwyneth Paltrow | Daniel Craig | Jared Harris | Amira Casar | Andrew Havill | Sam Troughton | Lucy Davenport | Antony Strachan | Blythe Danner | Michael Gambon | Eliza Wade, Il giovane favoloso | Tom & Viv | Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle | Henry & June | Black Butterflies | Capote

From the vantage point of his villa in Ravello Italy Vidal recalls his own tempestuous life and career all the while dispensing caustic barbs aimed at the country of his birth "The United States of Amnesia." The author's most famous literary works are touched upon notably his Broadway plays Visit to a Small Planet and The Best Man; his iconoclastic historical novels Burr and Lincoln; and of course his once-scandalous best-seller Myra Breckenridge. Also given ample airspace are Vidal's many plunges into the political arena (a natural outgrowth of his heritage coming as he did from a long line of Tennessee public servants) including his unsuccessful run for office; his ceaseless verbal assaults on the nation's Founding Fathers ("hucksters who were posing for history"); his shocking comments on the Kennedy clan during a 1973 telecast of The Dick Cavett Show; and his notorious 1968 TV confrontation with William F. Buckley which degenerated into a vicious name-calling session a lawsuit and a public apology from Buckley. Several of Vidal's friends associates and admirers appear on camera notably actors Eli Wallach Paul Newman Joanne Woodward Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon all of whom read passages from his novels. All in all this is a fascinating glimpse into the psyche of a man described by one associate as a "nasty witty shrewd contemptible fellow" and by other acquaintances as a warm personable caring gentleman. Previewed at the Sundance Film Festival January 20 2003 The Education of Gore Vidal made its TV debut six months later as part of PBS' American Masters anthology., Anne Jackson | Gore Vidal | Paul Newman | Tim Robbins | Eli Wallach | Joanne Woodward, Coal Miner's Daughter | An Inconvenient Truth | Murderball | The Fog of War | Trumbo | Public Speaking

The film covers several decades in the life of Harvard graduate Daniel Ellsberg (James Spader) who as a Pentagon official during two presidential administrations regards himself as patriotic as the next fellow. According to the unabashedly slanted teleplay by Jason Horwitch it is this sense of patriotism that compels Ellsberg to release a 7000-page classified report to The New York Times and The Washington Post revealing that the official story of America's "success" in Vietnam was both exaggerated and distorted and that the public has been egregiously misled for years. As a result of this act Ellsberg whose family life has already been destroyed by his devotion to his work faces charges of treason from the Nixon administration. Ironically it is Nixon's reaction to Ellsberg's security breach which leads him to create his team of gap-stopping "plumbers" -- who would of course bring about the President's downfall with the Watergate scandal. Surprisingly The Pentagon Papers premiered March 9 2003 over the FX network a cable service owned by the markedly conservative Rupert Murdoch., James Spader | Paul Giamatti | Claire Forlani | Alan Arkin | Hannah Lochner | Jonas Chernick | Michael Stevens, All the President's Men | Nixon | Advise and Consent | Kissinger and Nixon | Path to War | The Contender

The film follows the traditional rags-to-riches route as Martha rises from a poverty-stricken childhood in Nutley NJ to the head of a vast financial empire largely founded upon her talent for whipping up inexpensive gourmet meals and her sagacious tasteful home-decorating tips. (It is explained that this metamorphosis is borne of necessity after Martha's lawyer husband Andy [Tim Matheson] suffers a lengthy spell of unemployment.) Much is made of the contrast between the sweet benign "public" Stewart and the hell-on-wheels "private" Stewart and of course a great deal of footage is devoted to the Wall Street insider-trading scandal that brought about her spectacular downfall. Highlights include a vivid recreation of the confrontation between Stewart and TV host Jane Clayson on the set of CBS' Morning Show.

Perry Karavello is an actor whose talent does not quite reach the level of his ambition but that has not stopped him from pursuing the vain bitch goddess success for nearly ten years. During this time comedians Tony Barbieri and Don Barris proclaiming their undying friendship for Karavello promise him that some day they would help him get his big break in a high-budget action film. The dream seems within Karavello's grasp when at long last he lands the starring role of "sports private eye" Stone Fury in the upcoming Chicago-based film Windy City Heat. There's only one problem: There is no such film. The movie and the grueling events leading up to its "production date" (including an outrageous meeting with the supposed Japanese "money men") are all part of an outsized hoax cooked up by Barbieri Barris and director Bobcat Goldthwait. Need we add that the hapless Karavello is kept in the dark right up the moment that the director shout's "That's a wrap"?

But Andre and Cal have big plans. They're going to be famous one day. And they're going to teach what they see as a valuable lesson to everyone at their hated high school.

The Germans had overextended their military in Hitler's haste to conquer all of the Soviet Union. Here they fought the Russians for several grueling months through sub-zero temperatures dealing with disease and hunger.

Tori Spelling stars as Carol Cummings a fabulously wealthy and enormously successful TV talk show host -- and a first-class shrew. Caring little for anything but the money and the celebrity that her job accrues Carol mercilessly bullies and harangues everyone with whom she works from her ulcerated producer Jimmy Fields (Michael Landes) to her long-suffering personal assistant Roberta Timmons (Nina Siemaszko) a single mom who dares not risk losing her job -- especially with Christmas just a few days away. While feverishly putting together a Yuletide TV special Carol is visited by the ghost of her Aunt Marla (Dinah Manoff) who in her time was an even more insufferable diva than her niece. Warning Carol to change her ways before it is too late Aunt Marla further proclaims that Carol will that evening be visited by three spirits who will show her the error of her ways. From this point forward it's the same old story though it's fun to watch Gary Coleman as the Ghost of Christmas Past (appropriately in the form of a washed-up sitcom star!) and especially William Shatner as a Dr. Phil-style Ghost of Christmas Present. Also the film represents one of the few times that the Scrooge character has a living love interest -- namely Jason Brooks as John a well-known Good Samaritan who continues to pine for Carol even after she has decided that he's the proverbial millstone around her neck.

But when Prem (Hrithik Roshan who co-starred with Kapoor in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...) shows up he's exuberantly friendly athletic and handsome; and soon to her parents' delight Sanjana finds herself falling in love. Just when it seems like a happy ending is in store for everyone news comes that the wealthy businessman never showed up after all but sent his not-so-wealthy assistant and friend also named Prem in his place. Susheela is determined to end whatever is beginning between Sanjana and the first Prem so that Sanjana can marry the wealthier Prem (Abhishek Bachnan who made his film debut opposite Kapoor in Refugee) who turns out to be a very reserved young man but one who has a poet's soul and longs for love. For comic relief there's also a computer-generated parrot and a partly animated dog with the same name as Prem's assistant Johnny (Johnny Lever). Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon was written and directed by Sooraj R. Barjatya the grandson of Rajshri Productions founder Shri Tarachand Barjatya. It was his fourth feature with a hero named Prem but the first in which Prem was not played by Salman Khan. Anu Malik composed the score.

Balancing the cocky swagger of a rock & roll reprobate with the introspective soul of a poet Westerberg developed a reputation as one of the best rock songwriters of his day but the Replacements' scrappy but heartfelt music never won a mainstream following and Westerberg's first three solo albums received a mixed reception from critics and fans and failed to make an impression in the marketplace. After a three-year layoff Westerberg returned to record stores and the concert stage in 2002 with a new album recorded by himself in his home studio and a low-key concert tour featuring just Paul and his electric guitar. Paul Westerberg: Come Feel Me Tremble is a documentary which combines concert footage (some shot by fans with camcorders) behind-the-scenes glimpses of life on the road interviews with Westerberg as he discusses his work and a peek at his low-tech recording process.

Sgt. Nathan West (Samuel L. Jackson) is the leader of an elite team of U.S. Army Special Forces operatives known as the Army Rangers; West is known as a highly effective officer but one with a short temper and aggressive attitude who is not well liked by his soldiers. During a seemingly routine training exercise in Panama a hurricane sweeps in and four of West's six men are dead while West himself seems to have vanished. Eager to get the facts behind what happened Col. Bill Styles (Tim Daly) assigns Capt. Julia Osborne (Connie Nielsen) to investigate. However Osborne is having a hard time getting the two survivors to talk so Styles brings in Tom Hardy (John Travolta) a former Army Ranger who served under West and became a first-class interrogator; Hardy later became a DEA agent but left law enforcement after allegations of corruption. Hardy interviews Dunbar (Brian Van Holt) who claims that the four soldiers had been murdered and West was killed in retaliation. Kendall (Giovanni Ribisi) the other survivor (whose father is a powerful officer) has a very different story of how the five men turned up dead and it's up to Hardy and Osborne to determine who is telling the truth -- or if anyone is saying exactly what happened.

Entertainment, Triumph of the Spirit, Members of the Clergy, Catholicism corruption king monk Pope theology Vatican, , The life of one of the controversial figures in the history of modern religion is brought to the screen in this historical biography. Born in 1483 Martin Luther (Joseph Fiennes) was an intelligent and principled young man who was studying law in early 16th century Germany when a close brush with death led him to follow a spiritual path and join a Catholic monastery. Under the guidance of Johann von Staupitz (Bruno Ganz) Luther became a valued member of the monastery's hierarchy and as a sign of his trust von Staupitz asked Luther to join him for a voyage to Rome as part of church business. Luther was appalled by the corrupt practices of the leading church officials in particular the sale of "indulgences" in which the wealthy could purchase forgiveness for a wide variety of sins. Luther left the monastery to study theology in Wittenberg; a keen student he later became a professor and won the support of Frederick the Wise (Peter Ustinov) who also recognized the potential controversy of Luther's iron principles. When a new pope Leo X assumes the throne at the Vatican he orders the construction of St. Peter's Basilica. To pay the costs an ambitious monk Johann Tetzel (Alfred Molina) was sent out to sell indulgences to both the wealthy and the poor leaving his audiences with little doubt of the eternal consequences that awaited those who did not empty their purses. An infuriated Luther wrote an angry essay on the corruption of the church entitled "95 Theses" and thanks to the recent invention of the printing press Luther's words were soon circulated throughout Europe leading to an angry conflict with Catholic officials which threatened to tear the church in two.

But when a rich couple named The Queen (Michael Praed) and Golders Green (Simon Godley) turn up dead Kenny and Byron think they've found the solution to their financial woes. Rumor has it that Golders Green kept a wad of cash squirreled away in his mattress. Unfortunately several other colorful low-lives have their eyes on the prize from The Desperate Dwarf (Raymond Griffiths) to The Iron Lady (Karen Sharman). As the queer corpses continue to pile up Kenny and Byron wonder whether they'll ever locate the loot -- and whether their newfound occupation has deeper implications.

It's clear that McElhinney's film falls more into the "inspired by" category. The film opens with file footage of a woman giving birth through an episiotomy. This is accompanied by a voice-over that briefly describes Bataille's life and the furor his work caused. We are then transported to a dingy basement nightclub in some unknown era where a young man (Sean Timothy Sexton) manipulates his "joystick" while watching two exotic dancers (Courtney Shea and Melissa Elizabeth Forgione) in elaborate costumes. Sexton is later seen mistreating a black servant (Claude Barrington White) who is dressed in bondage gear. White answers the front door to find a skinny white man in a sailor suit (Querelle Haynes) and the two engage in consensual rough sex. They are violently interrupted. Later Forgione awakens in another room wearing a bloody bandage over her eyes. She fumbles her way down a dark hallway where she discovers Shea in a dog cage. Forgione frees Shea and the two have relations with a big blue sex toy. They are interrupted by Sexton. Later presumably the next morning a battered looking Shea walks down a decrepit hallway and up a flight of stairs again and again. Eventually she reaches a room from which she witnesses the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Then she encounters Sexton and Shea. McElhinney dedicates his film to French silent serial maker Louis Feuillade (responsible for Judex and Les Vampires) and to pornographer Stephen Sayadian (Café Flesh)., , Downloading Nancy | Naked Lunch | sex lies and videotape | It Is Fine!

Using old photos etchings recreated footage and dramatic readings of first-hand accounts this black-and-white film explores the history of the town which at the time of the flood had become a major center of steel production in the U.S. Dreyfuss describes how the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club a resort for the wealthy (one of its patrons was Andrew Carnegie) allowed the dam to fall into disrepair and the reservoir to fill far higher than the engineers who built the dam had ever intended. Heavy rains contributed to the problem and on the day of the flood the water overflowed and the dam collapsed sending a huge gusher of water coursing through the Conemaugh River Valley destroying everything in its path. When the water reached the town nearly an hour later the wave was cresting nearly 40 feet high. More than 2000 people were killed -- drowned crushed by debris or burned in fires caused by the cataclysm. In the aftermath people around the country rallied to help the survivors rebuild the town.

Kennedy Jr. Story, Drama, Biopic [feature], , 95, USA, , 4, , Eric Laneuville, , , , Looking For Love | Mothers and Sons, law-student politician son editor magazine romance marriage, , Originally titled America's Son this cable-TV biopic of John F. Kennedy Jr. begins at the end with the plane crash of July 19 1999 that took the lives of Kennedy his wife Caroline and his sister-in-law. From this tragic vantage point the film segues into flashbacks detailing the very public life of J.F.K. Sr.'s only son of whom it was once said "The world knew his name before he did." Based on The Day John Died a book by George Andersen the film intimates that "John-John" would have been happy charting his own course in life but was instead channelled into following in the Kennedy tradition by his iron-willed mother Jacqueline (played by Jacqueline Bisset who'd previously essayed an à clef version of Jackie O. in the theatrical feature The Greek Tycoon). Thus John enters law school where he is twice humiliated by failing to pass the bar exam. Finally as editor of the high-profile George magazine John can stand on his own merits and not as an adjunct of the Kennedy mystique. Naturally the film devotes time aplenty to J.F.K. Jr.'s well-publicized romances notably his lengthy association with actress Daryl Hannah (here played by Tara Chocol) and his ultimate marriage to Caroline Bessette (Portia de Rossi). Somewhat undercutting the credibility of the restaged scenes is the producers' utilization of interviews with the actual friends and associates of John Jr. -- not to mention film clips of the "real" Kennedy employed as bridges between scenes.

The charm of the "Eloise" books has proven elusive whenever the property is adapted for another media as witness a disastrous musical version which aired live on Playhouse 90 in 1956. On this occasion Eloise came off as a spoiled obstreperous brat which was as much the fault of the child actress cast in the role (Evelyn Rudie) as the adapters. Disney decided to give little Eloise another chance 47 years later with the location-filmed Eloise at the Plaza a two-hour movie presentation of ABC's The Wonderful World of Disney anthology. This time around Sofia Vassilieva played the title role with Julie Andrews as Eloise's nanny (something of a full-circle for Andrews who won an Oscar for her portrayal of a rather different nanny in the 1964 Disney theatrical feature Mary Poppins). The plot finds Eloise insisting upon attending a debutante ball at the Plaza and further conniving to have a runaway foreign prince (Denis Akiyama) -- who isn't much older than she is -- as her escort. Our heroine also mends fences between a reluctant teenage deb and the girl's pushy mother. Jeffrey Tambor is typecast as the Plaza's supercilious concierge Mr. Salomone whose dithering efforts to keep Eloise from nosing into other people's business avail him not one bit. Hilary Knight appears in a cameo role as himself. Eloise at the Plaza first aired April 27 2003., Julie Andrews | Christine Baranski | Jeffrey Tambor | Sofia Vassilieva | Debra Monk | Victor A.

But Sarah isn't forthcoming about her past and Mother Emmanuelle (Carmen Maura) who runs the convent doesn't even want Joachim to treat the young woman. Through his investigations Joachim learns that Sarah has a twin sister to whom she may have some kind of psychic connection. Delving deeper into the past he discovers that Gaëlle went to prison for a horrible crime at around the same time Sarah entered the convent.

They're being followed by the coolly sarcastic Solange (Michelle Jones) who also serves as our narrator; her hot-tempered lover Joaquim (Keith Brunsmann); and his seemingly dim indolent brother Nicky (Ryan Barton-Grimley). These three plan to kidnap poor Corrine in order to keep Guy from ripping off a large sum of money they'd earlier entrusted to him. The whole group checks into a posh resort whereupon the trio makes their move. While Solange and Joaquim keep a close eye on Guy (particularly close -- intimate even -- on Solange's part) Nicky drags Corrine to a ratty hut in the middle of a vast banana plantation. Guy alternately tries to trick his captors into releasing his wife and to convince them that he's working in everyone's best interests setting up a real estate deal (aided by unique Costa Rican property laws) that will make them all rich. While he clearly believes he can talk his way out of trouble his natural antipathy toward the abrasive Joaquim occasionally gets the better of him. Meanwhile Nicky proves much too sensitive to be a good kidnapper and is increasingly attracted to Corrine who learns the hard way what a sleazeball her devoted husband is.

One night Gale was seduced by an attractive student from his class Berlin (Rhona Mitra) who had too much to drink; later the remorseful student accused Gale of rape. While Gale was eventually cleared of the charges the negative publicity cost him his career as an educator and with no job and no wife Gale turned to drink.

On board are Rosa Maria (Leonor Silveira) and daughter Maria Joana (Filipa de Almedia).

In these discussions each individual speaks to the others in his or her native language sans any difficulty of understanding from the others. Then a darker truth about the nature of the ship itself emerges and sets the film up for an unexpectedly horrifying ending.

Alfredo Lopez (Javier Cámara) is an encyclopedia salesman whose work has not been going especially well lately which is worrisome to his wife Carmen (Candela Peña) who is eager to have a baby. As it happens encyclopedia sales have been dismal overall and publisher Don Carlos (Juan Diego) strikes upon an idea for a more lucrative product line -- an "audiovisual encyclopedia of human reproduction" consisting of 8 mm movies demonstrating different ways for couples to make love. Don Carlos sets up a meeting between his sales staff and Dennis (Thomas Bo Larsen) a pornographer from Denmark who likes to tell people he once worked with Ingmar Bergman. While most of the salesmen refuse to have anything to do with Don Carlos' new scheme -- especially since pornography is strictly illegal under the Franco regime -- Alfredo grudgingly goes along and despite initial misgivings Carmen is drafted to star in the first film in the series. As the films become an underground success in Spain and earn a more high-profile reputation in Denmark Carmen is recognized in public as a glamorous porn star and Alfredo deludes himself into believing he and Dennis are making art films. But Alfredo's ambitions get the better of him when he begins writing a screenplay for a serious feature film and Carmen becomes increasingly obsessed with having a child., Candela Peña | Juan Diego | Thomas Bo Larsen | Fernando Tejero, Blancanieves | Ayer no termina nunca | The Serial | Eating Raoul | Elektra Luxx | Le Sex Shop

Standing in for the original's Robert Preston is Matthew Broderick as "Professor" Harold Hill a glib traveling salesman who descends upon the town of River City IA in the weeks just prior to the Fourth of July celebration of 1912. Persuading the populace that the youth of River City is in great danger of being corrupted by the presence of a new pool table Hill convinces them that their only hope for salvation is the organization of a boy's band with himself as a leader. Naturally this will require the parents to shell out good money for band instruments and uniforms and in exchange Hill promises to teach the kids how to make music by utilizing his revolutionary "Think System." There's only one problem: Harold Hill is an out-and-out con artist who doesn't know one note from another. Even so he manages to win over everybody in town except local librarian/music teacher Marian Paroo (Kristin Chenoweth) and thick-eared Mayor Shinn (Victor Garber). Ultimately however Marian joins Hill's camp -- mainly because he has brought her sullen brother Winthrop (Cameron Monaghan) out of his shell -- but as July Fourth approaches Hill faces exposure and arrest thanks to a vengeful anvil salesman named Charlie Cowell (Patrick McKenna). A meticulously faithful rendition of the Broadway original The Music Man happily includes all of the show's wonderful songs among them "Ya Got Trouble" "Seventy-Six Trombones" "The Sadder-But-Wiser Girl" "Lida Rose" "Marian the Librarian" "Pickalittle" "Til There Was You" and "My White Knight" (which was not used in the 1962 movie adaptation). Though some critics found Matthew Broderick a bit too lightweight and Jeff Bleckner's direction a tad gimmicky no one could fault the full-bodied vocal renditions nor the consistently inventive choreography of Kathleen Marshall.
