When Woody's dutiful son David (Forte) arrives at the local police station to pick him up shortly thereafter we learn exactly why the old man was so singularly focused on his stride: Having recently received a sweepstakes letter stating that he has won one million dollars Woody is determined to claim his prize in person at the company's head office in Nebraska. Although David discerns right away that the letter is little more than a scam to sell magazine subscriptions stubborn Woody already has tunnel vision -- nothing will stop him from obtaining his jackpot even if he has to walk 800 miles on his own two feet to do so. Of course this doesn't sit well with Woody's outspoken wife Kate (June Squibb) or career-driven son Ross (Bob Odenkirk) but David is determined to humor his befuddled father nonetheless eventually agreeing to drive him to the sweepstakes office personally despite having to call in sick to work to get the time off. Shortly after the two set out however the road trip threatens to get sidetracked when longtime alcoholic Woody winds up in the hospital following a drunken fall. Pushing their schedule back to make time for his recovery the pair plan to take a detour to David's Aunt Peg's house in his father's hometown of Hawthorne where Kate and Ross will soon arrive for an impromptu family reunion. When Woody runs into his old pal Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) at a local tavern and shoots his mouth off about his recent "windfall" he becomes something of a local celebrity and familiar faces come out of the woodwork to claim their fair share of the prize.

Ushio met Noriko Shinohara a 19-year-old art student who had just arrived in the United States; the two fell into a relationship that was destined to become permanent when Noriko became pregnant a few months later. Four decades on Ushio and Noriko are still together but their relationship is not always a healthy one; he's an alcoholic who dominates the marriage and is clearly resentful that his career in art has not been more successful especially since Noriko has caught the attention of critics with her own work which uses comic-style images to express messages of female empowerment inspired by her own life. Filmmaker Zachary Heinzerling offers an emotionally intense look into the sometimes volatile balance between two talented but combative personalities in the documentary Cutie and the Boxer.

Though patriarch Ernest Hemingway established a reputation as the single most brilliant American writer of the 20th Century his life was marred by violent inner turmoil that ended with the shocking act of suicide. In successive years two of Hemingway's granddaughters Margaux and Mariel achieved fame in their own right - the former as a fashion model and actress the latter as an actress. But the siblings experienced much different levels of success; while Margaux floundered in B-budget direct-to-video pictures such as They Call Me Bruce Mariel earned acclaim for her outstanding work in such contemporary classics as Star 80 Personal Best and Manhattan. This schism drove a rift between the sisters and in time Margaux began to experience severe emotional problems of her own that in an eerie echo of Ernest's fate led to a tragic suicide in 1996. In Running from Crazy acclaimed documentarian Barbara Kopple etches out a portrait of the Hemingway family reflects on Margaux's life via family documentary footage and most significantly focuses on Mariel as she struggles to overcome the tragic legacy of her grandfather and sister by living a healthy lifestyle that will steer her as far away from depression as possible.

While the studio looked utilitarian on the outside and was located in a less-than-glamorous part of Southern California it boasted a state-of-the-art recording console designed by Rupert Neve and the studio's acoustics gave music a big powerful sound that was perfect for rock & roll. Beginning with Neil Young's After The Gold Rush in 1970 many of the biggest acts of the day came to Sound City to put their music on tape and bands and performers such as Fleetwood Mac Tom Petty Elton John Santana Johnny Cash and the Grateful Dead all cut albums there. In 1991 Nirvana came to Sound City to record their breakthrough album Nevermind and the studio soon found a new clientele with alternative rockers such as Nine Inch Nails the Red Hot Chili Peppers Tool and Rage Against the Machine booking time at the studio. But as digital technology became the industry standard by the end of the 1990s Sound City's analog gear fell out of favor and the owners sold off the trademark Neve recording console. That console was purchased by musician Dave Grohl who recorded at Sound City with Nirvana and the Foo Fighters and Grohl offers a look back at the studio's glory days in the documentary Sound City. Along with interviews with many of the artists and technicians who worked at Sound City the film examines how the rise of digital recording technology has changed the music business and impacted the way many musicians work.

With the release of El Topo (1970) and its psychedelic follow-up The Holy Mountain (1973) Jodorowsky became not only a pioneer of psychedelic surrealism in film but also the father of the "Midnight Movie." Following the success of those two films the Chilean director began focusing all of his energies on translating Dune to the big screen. The film was to star Jodorowsky's own son Brontis along with a stunning cast that included Orson Welles David Carradine Mick Jagger and Salvador Dali with Pink Floyd providing the score and art direction by H.R. Giger and Jean "Moebius" Giraud. Two years into the massive production however the film was suddenly and unceremoniously cancelled. Yet even today numerous relics of that ambitious production -- including thousands of enticingly vivid storyboards -- still exist.

Berger is the founder of the New York theater company Collective: Unconscious and in 1999 with Patrick Daniels and Irving Gregory he wrote and directed a play called Charlie Victor Romeo in which a handful of actors reenact scenes taken from the transcripts of "black box" recordings that preserve critical moments during disasters aboard commercial airline flights. The film adaptation of Charlie Victor Romeo deliberately emphasizes the project's origins on the stage (with 3D camerawork capturing the depth and dimensions of the performance space) but by allowing the audience to more closely study the actors as they portray real-life figures facing almost certain death while struggling not to alarm their passengers they've added to the intimacy of an unusual study of people struggling to make sense of a potential catastrophe.

But Diana is keeping a big secret -- she's having an affair with Eric Tull (Will Brittain) a student at her school. Eric is handsome confident and comes from a wealthy family; he could have any girl in his class but seems to enjoy being able to make Diana do his bidding from furtive sexual encounters in her car to demanding that she send him erotic text messages. While neither Diana nor Eric have told anyone else about their relationship it seems likely that someone will eventually find out which turns out to be both dangerous and exciting for Diana.

When Virgil receives a call from a young woman who seeks his assistance in removing some works of art owned by her family he offers his services and travels to the designated site to assess the situation.

Jack Marcus (Clive Owen) is a prep-school English teacher who sees his students' obsession with social media as a literary and intellectual abyss. His alcoholism is slowly taking over his life as his estranged son drifts ever further away and the school's once-proud literary magazine lapses into irrelevance. Meanwhile art teacher and abstract painter Dina Delsanto (Juliette Binoche) wrestles with debilitating arthritis that has forced her to lay down her paintbrush indefinitely. Jack respects Dina and even flirts with her on occasion but he has a cruel habit of riling her that leads to swelling tensions between the two teachers. As Jack's performance review draws near he knows that his continued failure to engage his students could cost him his job. Out of Jack's desperation comes a flash of innovation and he boldly issues a challenge to his rival in the visual arts: Convinced that a mere picture could never truly convey the emotion and nuance of the English language Jack challenges Dina to create a painting that's as powerful as his own written words.

In the not-too-distant future rampant crime and prison overcrowding have inspired the U.S. government to implement a unique solution to restore the peace: Each year for a 12-hour period any and all crime becomes permissible as police put their jobs on hold and hospitals close their doors. It's called the Purge and remarkably the annual event leads to drastically reduced crime and record-low unemployment levels throughout the rest of the year. But this year as suburban parents James (Ethan Hawke) and Mary (Lena Headey) place their home on lockdown for the annual event a desperate man finds his way into their neighborhood while fleeing a sadistic gang of masked killers. In a moment of compassion James and Mary's adolescent son (Max Burkholder) unlocks the door offering sanctuary to the frightened stranger. Unfortunately for the entire family that act of kindness may also be their very last because now the killers who were pursuing the man have surrounded the house and have vowed to kill everyone inside unless they are willingly given the man they are hunting within an hour. As the clock begins to tick the family face a difficult dilemma -- do they sacrifice the life of a stranger in hopes of saving themselves or attempt to stand their ground until the Purge expires?, Ethan Hawke | Lena Headey | Adelaide Kane | Max Burkholder | Edwin Hodge | Rhys Wakefield | Tony Oller | Arija Bareikis | Tom Yi | Chris Mulkey | Tisha French | Dana Bunch | Peter Gvozdas | John Weselcouch | Alicia Vela-Bailey, The Strangers | Safe House | Trespass | The Call | ATM | The Numbers Station

As the movement suddenly gained mass support and became the focus of international media attention Egypt was on the brink of revolution. When Hosni Mubarak left office many Egyptians were caught between elation and anxiety as the nation confronted both fresh possibilities and an uncertain future especially after military interference and hastily organized elections derailed the hopes of the activists who founded the movement against Mubarak. Filmmaker Jehane Noujaim was a regular visitor to Tahrir Square and the documentary Al Midan (aka The Square) captures Egypt's political upheaval as it was happening with activists and would-be revolutionaries of all stripes speaking their minds and watching the government react as the world watches them all. The Square received its American premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival., Khalid Abdalla, Four Days in November | Capitalism: A Love Story | Gerrymandering | Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election | Our Brand Is Crisis | Under African Skies
