While the courtship and reproductive patterns of animals had been carefully documented Kinsey believed that most "established facts" about human sexual behavior were a matter of conjecture rather than research and that what most people said about their sex lives was not born out by the evidence (a subject that had personal resonance for him given the troubles he and his wife Clara Kinsey had in the early days of their marriage). After introducing a course in "Marriage" at Indiana University which offered frank and factual information on sex to students Kinsey began an exhaustive series of interviews with a wide variety of people from all walks of life in order to find out the truth about sex practices in America. When he published Sexual Behavior and the Human Male in 1948 his findings were wildly controversial indicating that most men had a wider variety of sexual experiences than most people imagined including a number of practices commonly thought to be dangerous or perverted (including pre-marital sex same-sex contacts and masturbation). An even greater outcry greeted Kinsey's next volume Sexual Behavior and the Human Female which contradicted common notions than most women went into marriage sexually inexperienced. Kinsey is a film biography written and directed by Bill Condon which examines Kinsey's life and work from his strict childhood until his death in 1956. Liam Neeson plays Alfred Kinsey and Laura Linney co-stars as Kinsey's wife and colleague Clara.

Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina the hotel manager at the fancy Les Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. Paul is a Hutu and a very successful businessman who smoothly greases the wheels making powerful connections in all strata of Rwandan life. His wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo of Aeon Flux) is a Tutsi. She urges Paul to use his influence to help local Tutsis who are being harassed and beaten with increasing frequency but Paul will only use the political capital he's built up to help his own family if and when they need it. Soon enough the violence escalates and the Hutus begin their genocide of the Tutsis. European guests and staff at the hotel are flown out of the country and Paul is left in charge. He finds that his conscience won't allow him to watch as the innocent are slaughtered and before long the hotel has become a well-appointed refugee camp. Paul is seen as a traitor by some putting his life in danger and the predicament of his "guests" grows more precarious every day but despite good intentions on the part of a journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) and a UN peacekeeping colonel (Nick Nolte) the rest of the world is not eager to intervene and stop the massacre.

The Aviator follows Hughes (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) as the twentysomething millionaire having already made a fortune improving the design of oil-drilling bits comes to Hollywood with an interest in getting into the picture business. It doesn't take long for Hughes with his passion for airplanes to jump from producer to director of his first major film project a World War I air epic called Hell's Angels which took three years to complete thanks to the shift from silent to sound filming and Hughes' relentless perfectionism. However the film was a massive hit and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood making Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani) a star and enjoying a romance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). But Hollywood's old-boy network never fully accepted Hughes and in time his passion for flying began to reclaim his attentions as he began designing new planes setting air speed records flying around the world and risking his life testing aircraft. Hughes also found time to romance Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and founded his own airline Trans-World Airlines though as his ideas became bolder his approach became more eccentric and he gained many powerful enemies including the head of Pan-American Airlines Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) and Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) who attempted to prove that Hughes' radical design ideas were actually part of an effort to bilk taxpayers for millions of dollars through government contracts.

However there are more people than her rapidly aging mother and ill neighbor who depend on Vera's care. Though abortion was illegal and of course widely frowned upon in the '50s Vera sees women going through unwanted pregnancies the same as she would anyone else -- human beings deserving of treatment. With this in mind she regularly induces miscarriages for those who need them and her patients are consistently grateful for her gentleness and understanding. Unfortunately for Vera the law doesn't see her as aiding those in need; they interpret the abortions as murder as do most of the other people in her life. When Vera's activities are revealed her family life and relationships with those around her -- including the ones she helped nurse back to health -- are put in jeopardy.

Ram√≥n Sampedro (Javier Bardem) was a fisherman and part-time poet who at the age of 26 suffered an accident while diving that left him a bedridden quadriplegic. Now 54 Ram√≥n must depend on his family to survive -- his macho brother Jos√© (Celso Bugallo) Jos√©'s wife Manuela (Mabel Rivera) and their son Javi (Tamar Novas). While grateful to his family and friends for their help Ram√≥n was always an active person and as the years wore on he has come to see his life as frustrating and pointless and wishes to die with what remains of his dignity. Jos√© however is bitterly opposed to the notion of assisted suicide and Spanish laws would implicate anyone who helped Ram√≥n end his own life which is something Ram√≥n does not want to do. Through Gen√© (Carla Segura) a friend who works with a "Right to Die" organization Ram√≥n is introduced to Julia (Belen Rueda) a lawyer he hopes will help him persuade the courts to let him end his own life. Julia is dealing with her own mortality issues since being diagnosed with a degenerative disease and Ram√≥n hopes her condition will make her arguments more persuasive. As Ram√≥n and Julia work together on his case and help to prepare a book of his poems for publication Ram√≥n finds himself falling in love with his attorney who happens to be married but while his infatuation gives Julia second thoughts about the case Ram√≥n remains convinced that the greatest gift to him would be an end to his life.

Enrique Goded (Fele Mart√≠nez) is a Spanish filmmaker who is having trouble settling on a new project when he's approached by Ignacio Rodriguez (Gael Garc√≠a Bernal) who was his close friend when they were schoolboys. Goded who fell in love for the first time with Rodriguez barely recognizes the man as his former crush but agrees to read the short story he's written. The tale turns out to be an semi-autobiographical account of their days in a Catholic boarding school in which a cross-dressing night-club performer named Zahara (also played by Bernal) hooks up with a man named Enrique (Alberto Ferreiro) who turns out to have been his first lover when he was a student. Recalling their school days Zahara tracks down Father Manolo (Daniel Gim√©nez Cacho) one of his teachers from school with pedophilic tendencies and threatens to expose the priest's attempts to seduce him and ruin his relationship with Enrique years ago. Goded decides to use the story as the basis for his next film and Rodriguez an out-of-work actor makes it clear he's eager to play Zahara. However Goded isn't certain if Rodriguez is the right actor for the role or if he's even the man he claims to be; an angry conflict with Rodriguez leads Goded back to the real Ignacio's mother (Petra Mart√≠nez)., Fele Mart√≠nez | Gael Garc√≠a Bernal | Petra Mart√≠nez | Alberto Ferreiro | Leonor Watling | Francisco Boira | Francisco Maestre | Juan Fernandez, Mulholland Dr. | The Crying Game | Mona Lisa | The Crime of Padre Amaro | Intruso | Don't Move

The film based on the book by Fortune Magazine reporters Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind opens with a reenactment of the suicide of Enron executive Cliff Baxter then travels back in time describing Enron chairman Kenneth Lay's humble beginnings as the son of a preacher his ascent in the corporate world as an "apostle of deregulation" his fortuitous friendship with the Bush family and the development of his business strategies in natural gas futures. The film points out that the culture of financial malfeasance at Enron was evident as far back as 1987 when Lay apparently encouraged the outrageous risk taking and profit skimming of two oil traders in Enron's Valhalla office because they were bringing a lot of money into the company. But it wasn't until eventual CEO Jeff Skilling arrived at Enron that the company's "aggressive accounting" philosophy truly took hold. The Smartest Guys in the Room explores the lengths to which the company went in order to appear incredibly profitable. Their win-at-all-costs strategy included suborning financial analysts with huge contracts for their firms hiding debts by essentially having the company loan money to itself and using California's deregulation of the electricity market to manipulate the state's energy supply. Gibney's film reveals how Lay Skilling and other execs managed to keep their riches while thousands of lower-level employees saw their loyalty repaid with the loss of their jobs and their retirement funds. The filmmaker posits the Enron scandal not as an anomaly but as a natural outgrowth of free-market capitalism., Peter Coyote, Bowling For Columbine | Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer | Startup.com | The Corporation | Sarah Palin: You Betcha! | Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps

In the summer of 1981 Brian (George Webster) and Neil (Chase Ellison) are both eight years old and playing on the same little league baseball team in a small Kansas town. One day after a game Brian blacks out after getting caught in a rainstorm and five hours later he finds himself sitting in his basement with his nose bleeding and no memory of what happened to him. Over the years the event -- particularly the missing five hours -- weigh heavily on his mind and he becomes convinced that he was kidnapped by space aliens. Teenaged Brian (now played by Brady Corbet) becomes friends with Avalyn Friesen (Mary Lynn Rajskub) a woman who claims to have been abducted by aliens on several occasions and she urges him to look to his dreams for patterns that might suggest what happened to him. Meanwhile during the same summer Neil developed a powerful crush on their little league coach (Bill Sage) who appeared to have also taken a shine to Neil. Neil's mother (Elisabeth Shue) seeing nothing wrong with their friendship lets the coach look after Neil while she's off on one of her many dates and before long Neil begins sexually experimenting with the older man. Neil's introduction to sex inspires him to become a hustler when he grows into his teens and after burning his bridges in his hometown Neil (now played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his close friend Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg) move to New York where he continues to cruise for a living but under significantly more risky circumstances. One day Neil is contacted by Brian who after seeing one of their team photos from their days in little league suspects he might have some clues as to what happened to him in 1981. Mysterious Skin was based on the novel by Scott Heim and marked the first time Gregg Araki made a film that did not originate with one of his own screenplays., Brady Corbet | Joseph Gordon-Levitt | Michelle Trachtenberg | Jeff Licon | Bill Sage | Mary Lynn Rajskub | Elisabeth Shue | Chase Ellison | Lisa Long | Chris Mulkey | Billy Drago | Richard Riehle, johns | Speedway Junky | My Own Private Idaho | Ethan Mao | L.I.E. | Closet Monster

Peter Sellers (Geoffrey Rush) was raised by a domineering mother (Miriam Margolyes) and meek father (Peter Vaughan) and at an early age discovered he liked to hide behind the emotional curtain of playing a character. In time Sellers put this skill to use as an actor and discovered he had a great gift for comedy. In the late '50s Sellers rose to fame on the wildly popular radio series The Goon Show alongside Spike Milligan (Edward Tudor Pole) and Harry Secombe (Steve Pemberton) but as his success on radio gave way to stardom on the big screen Sellers' ego began to get the better of him. While working on a film with Sophia Loren (Sonia Aquino) Sellers fell in love with the great Italian beauty and eventually left his wife Anne (Emily Watson) to pursue her; when it became clear that Loren wanted nothing to do with him Sellers fell into an affair with her stand-in instead. Professionally Sellers career hits a new high when he agrees to take a role in a picture being directed by American filmmaker Blake Edwards (John Lithgow) called The Pink Panther and personally he finds a new love with the beautiful Britt Ekland (Charlize Theron). But Sellers' mood swings eventually put paid to their marriage and while he finds commercial success as a funnyman onscreen he achieves little in the way of happiness or respect.

However when it quickly became obvious that the treaty was for practical purposes a sham Lt. Gen. Rom√©o Dallaire the Canadian leader of the UN's 800-man peace-keeping force learned his troops were all but powerless to do anything to help. Failed actions in Somalia and Yugoslavia had made the United Nations wary of becoming too deeply involved in Rwanda and as Dallaire and his men begged for additional troops and materiel to deal with the growing crisis (and the authority to clean out weapons caches the Rwandese Patriotic Front had assembled) they found themselves foiled on every turn. The world's major military powers saw no financial or political advantage to getting involved in the crisis in Rwanda so they refused to help and as a result 800000 Rwandans were slaughtered. Dallaire regarded this as a predictable and preventable act of genocide executed by the Hutu-controlled government against Hutu oppositionists and Tutsis...a massacre he could only watch without being able to help. Nearly ten years after the tragedy in Rwanda Dallaire returned to the nation to see what was left of the country he tried to protect; Shake Hands With the Devil: The Journey of Rom√©o Dallaire is a documentary which follows him as he discusses the massacre of Rwanda what could have been done and how the horrific experience has changed his life. The genocide in Rwanda also provides the basis for the acclaimed dramatic feature Hotel Rwanda (2004) in which a fictional character based on Rom√©o Dallaire is played by Nick Nolte., , Hotel Rwanda | Shake Hands With the Devil | Voices of Iraq | Promises

Based in California and blanketing sections of the state dominated by the movie business Z Channel had been operating for several years before former screenwriter Jerry Harvey took over as head of programming in 1980. Under the guidance of Harvey and his staff the channel became a film buff's dream screening rare classics important foreign films and maverick American titles that had fallen through the cracks of commercial distribution. Harvey and his staff also programmed original and uncut versions of films which had only played American theaters in altered form (including Heaven's Gate Once Upon a Time in America Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and The Leopard) long before the concept of the "director's cut" had currency beyond the most hardcore of film fans. And The Z Channel aggressively championed pictures they believed were overlooked and programmed deserving Oscar-nominated movies during the Academy's voting period years before studios began distributing video "screeners" to potential voters. (More than one industry expert has credited Z Channel's showings of Annie Hall as a key factor in the film winning Best Picture.) But Jerry Harvey was also a deeply troubled man and when legal and economic problems began dogging the company in the late '80s he snapped leading to a horrible and tragic murder and suicide. The Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession is a documentary that looks at the channel's short but remarkable history as well as Harvey's damaged personal life.

Mondovino offers a witty but well-informed look at how business concerns and the homogenization of tastes around the world are changing the way wine is being made. Nossiter's primary focus is on American vintners and their new degree of worldwide acceptance (in part due to the efforts of wildly influential U.S. wine critic Robert Parker) as well as French wine makers who are struggling to maintain a more traditional approach in the wake of a rapidly shifting business climate such as Hubert de Montille and Yvonne Hegoburu.

An avowed Marxist Allende believed that Western capitalism had done far more harm than good to his nation and in response he helped to found Chile's socialist party. In 1970 he ran for president on a platform which in part called for the nationalization of most of Chile's industrial and financial operations. Despite a fierce campaign against him (managed in part by United States intelligence forces) Allende won the election and made good on his pledges. While Allende was popular with his constituency he and his agenda of democratic socialism were seen as a threat by the United States and Henry Kissinger said of his election "I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people." In 1973 a coup d'etat backed by the United States toppled Allende's leadership and the former president soon committed suicide. General Augusto Pinochet rose to power in the wake of the coup leading to a 17-year reign of terror marked by torture and political executions. Salvador Allende is a documentary which looks at the political career of the fallen leader exploring both his rise to the presidency and the forces that collaborated to remove him from office against the will of the people. Former United States ambassador to Chile Edward Korry is among those interviewed about the American role in Allende's fall., , South of the Border | The Island President | The Brooklyn Connection: How to Build a Guerrilla Army | Moments with Fidel | The U.S. vs. John Lennon | One Bright Shining Moment: The Forgotten Summer of George McGovern

Filmmaker Hubert Sauper uses his documentary Darwin's Nightmare to explore the lives of these people and those who come from other countries to do business. As the film explains sometime in the 1960s some unknown party introduced Nile Perch into Lake Victoria setting an ecological downward spiral in motion. The aggressively predatory fish consumed nearly every other species in the lake. The perch grew to enormous size creating a booming business selling tons of filets to Europe. But few of the locals make a decent living from this thriving business. The fishermen and others work under dangerous conditions earn subsistence wages and are often unable to support their families. Those children live in the street scavenging for food. The girls often become prostitutes servicing the foreign pilots who bring in arms for conflicts in other regions and fly out with the fish leaving behind only the rotting carcasses and heads which many of the locals cannot even afford to eat. As disease spreads and famine threatens the ecology of the lake deteriorates since the smaller fish that eat algae and waste are no longer there to maintain the water's purity. Darwin's Nightmare won a European Film Award for Best Documentary in 2004.

Till came home several months later in a box; Till had supposedly whistled at a white woman and 14 white men angered by the young man's perceived arrogance beat him senseless shot him to death and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River weighing it down with an engine from a cotton gin. Emmett's mother Mamie Till was a fearless woman determined to see that justice was done (she had an open casket at Emmett's funeral and allowed Jet magazine to publish a photo of his badly mutilated body so others could see the full extent of the crime) but convicting white men on charges of lynching a black teenager in the Deep South in the 1950s was all but impossible and the two charged with Emmett's death Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam were found not guilty by a jury who deliberated for so short a period they stopped for a cold drink to stretch the wait to an hour. Only a few months later Bryant and Milam admitted they had committed the crime to a reporter from Look magazine knowing they were protected from further prosecution under double jeopardy statutes. The other 12 men involved in the crime were not charged. Almost 50 years later filmmaker Keith Beauchamp traveled to Mississippi to investigate the surviving characters in this heinous crime and The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till combines newsreel footage shot during the investigation of the murder in 1955 with present-day interviews including Till's cousins who watched helplessly as he was dragged away by an angry mob; Till's uncle who identified the guilty men in court; friends and co-workers of the men who committed the crimes (five of whom were still alive when the film was completed) and Mamie Till. In 2005 in part because of evidence uncovered by the filmmakers the Emmett Till case was reopened in Mississippi., , The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 | American Experience: The Murder of Emmett Till | 4 Little Girls | Booker's Place: A Mississippi Story | The Agronomist | Citizen King

Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) is a young and vital member of the aristocratic classes in 16th century Italy; however Bassanio's impulsive nature and lavish lifestyle have put him deeply in debt and he will need at least the pretense of a fortune if he is to win the hand of the beautiful Portia (Lynn Collins). Bassanio turns to his close friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons) a successful businessman for financial help but with much of his fortune tied up in a sailing expedition Antonio can do little to help him. To help Bassanio Antonio turns to Shylock (Al Pacino) a Jewish money lender who lives in Venice's Semetic ghetto. Antonio has often expressed his contempt for Shylock who charges high rates for his loans and Shylock clearly seems pleased at the ironic prospect of having Antonio as a customer; however instead of interest Shylock demands an unusual security on his loan -- though Shylock demands no interest if Antonio does not repay the three thousand ducats in three months Shylock will be entitled to a pound of his flesh.

They're more concerned with just getting through each day in one piece and it isn't always easy. In addition to the annoyed riders who bicker over having to show their tickets and passes there's Bootsie (Bence M√°ty√°ssy) an energetic young man who plays pranks on the agents and runs very fast and Sofie (Eszter Balla) the odd young woman who shows up on the train in a bear costume everyday and never pays her fare. Worst of all there's a dark and mysterious figure who's been pushing unsuspecting riders in front of oncoming trains with predictably grisly results. His superiors begin to suspect Bulcs√∫ when they realize he's been living in the system spending his nights sleeping on the platforms and never venturing above ground.

Director Sai gained critical kudos for this film because of its simplistic elegant approach and its steadfast resistance to excessive sentimentality and pathos., Kaoru Kobayashi | Kippei Shiina | Teruyuki Kagawa | Keiko Toda | Shinobu Terajima | Tomoka Kurotani | Yuko Natori, Hachi: A Dog's Tale | Italo | Departures | Red Dog | Luna: Spirit of the Whale | My Dog Skip

Vincent (Yvan Attal) Fred (Alain Cohen) and Georges (Alain Chabat) are three Parisian men in their early forties who are coming to the unfortunate realization that their love lives are not what they dreamed of in their youth. Vincent is married to Gabrielle (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and while there's still some spark left in their marriage it usually appears only after an argument. Vincent is having a furtive affair with a beautiful woman (Angie David) while Gabrielle is tempted to do the same when a handsome man in a record shop (Johnny Depp) begins silently flirting with her.

And Georges is reaching the end of his rope with his wife Nathalie (Emmanuelle Seigner) an abrasive feminist who insists on making every aspect of their lives a political matter but lacking the courage to break up with her Georges deals with his feelings in the traditional manner -- he buys a new car.

In 1976 Jimmy Carter was the first self-described born-again Christian to win the presidency and while many fundamentalist Christians quickly became dissatisfied with his leftist views his victory set a valuable precedent. Additionally as noted Christian commentators such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson took a far more active role in politics a growing number of political candidates (most of them Republicans) became aware of the importance of courting what became known as "the Religious Right" with George W. Bush enjoying particular success as he stressed moral and cultural issues in his two campaigns for president (and to a certain degree successfully camouflaging his reckless past) and openly courted the Christian vote.

When the nation quickly fell into debt the International Monetary Fund stepped in to give the nation massive loans -- a tactic that only sent Argentina deeper into the hole as the government struggled to pay the interest on their notes. The results were little short of disastrous sending the economy into a tailspin and forcing much of Argentina's industry to shut down. In 2001 following the example of other out-of-work laborers the former employees of an Argentinean auto plant walked into the abandoned factory where they once worked and announced their plans to take it over and run the business as a cooperative. The auto company's owners soon stepped in to claim what they said was theirs while labor advocates argued that since the company had been floated by IMF-backed loans before it closed the true ownership of the shop was an open question. The Take is a documentary by activist filmmakers Avi Lewis and Naomi Klein that chronicles the standoff between the displaced laborers occupying their former workplace and the private and public forces who united against them., Bill Clinton, Harlan County USA | American Dream | The U.S. vs. John Lennon | Ba Jiu Dianzhong De Taiyang | Heir to an Execution | Seeing Red

Creating a character called Tommy the Clown Johnson developed an act that combined hip-hop-flavored comedy and dancing with an anti-gang and anti-violence message. Johnson's performances became wildly popular in South Central -- so much so that at one point 50 different groups inspired by Johnson's example were performing in the area. In time Johnson's loose-limbed dance style inspired a new wave of hip-hop street dancing called "krumping" a wildly athletic style in which arms legs and bodies fly with a frenzied abandon that moves at almost inhuman speeds. Rize follows the birth of clown dancing and krumping in South Central and records how many young people have adopted the dance as a style of competition offering a safer and healthier alternative to the gang culture that has long dominated Los Angeles.

First published in 1903 the essay was a hoax (and was revealed as such for the first time in 1921 by the London Times) but that hasn't prevented it from having a long and troubling life as a widely distributed cornerstone of anti-Semitic hate literature; it's still in print around the world and was adapted for Egyptian television in the new millennium. When filmmaker Marc Levin was confronted with another widely disseminated bit of anti-Jewish propaganda (the false assertion that no Jews died in the World Trade Center attacks of September 11 2001) he developed a new curiosity about the Protocols and other "factual" sources of anti-Semitic hatred and set out to find out more about anti-Jewish propaganda. The result was Protocols of Zion a documentary which offers a surprising (and surprisingly witty) look at figures from the hate movement in America in elsewhere ranging from leader of the neo-Nazi National Alliance (who also sells Aryan Wear footwear) to an anti-Semitic media analyst who announces that Rupert Murdoch is actually a Jew. The film also examines Henry Ford's well-documented hatred of Jews anti-Semitism among radical African-Americans and the memories of Levin's father a self-described "All-American Jew.", Marc Levin | Al Levin | Abraham Foxman, 24 Days | A Bookshelf on Top of the Sky: Twelve Stories About John Zorn | Neshoba: The Price of Freedom | Banished: How Whites Drove Blacks Out of Town in America | The California Reich | Ever Again

Heidegger was also wildly controversial having embraced Nazism in 1933 though he often clashed with the party's leadership. In 1942 Heidegger delivered a series of lectures in which he analyzed at length the poem The Ister an ode to the Danube River written in the late 18th century by the German author Friedrich Holderlin. Rather than a simple celebration of verse Heidegger's talks used The Ister as a jumping-off point for discussions of technology cultural identity political change and the war which then gripped both Germany and the world.

Flor lands a high-paying job working as a housekeeper for Deborah Clasky (T√©a Leoni); Deborah doesn't speak a word of Spanish but this is hardly the most curious thing about their working relationship. A deeply troubled neurotic who has spent time in a mental hospital Deborah is at once obsessed with her duties as a wife and mother and utterly clueless to her family's needs and when she learns that Flor has a daughter she insists that the girl move in with the Claskys. Flor however isn't so sure she wants Deborah Americanizing Cristina especially when Deborah begins doting on the girl at the expense of her relationship with her own daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele). Deborah's husband John (Adam Sandler) is an oasis of loving calm and understanding in the midst of his chaotic family and Flor becomes attracted to this man who shows no signs of the arrogant machismo she's accustomed to. But John's career as a chef is turned upside down when The New York Times gives his restaurant a four-star review suddenly turning his small eatery into the "in" spot in Los Angeles. Meanwhile Flor reaches the end of her patience when Deborah enrolls Cristina into an exclusive private school which Flor is certain will turn her into a typical American child and drive a wedge between Cristina and her mother.

In London in the latter half of the 17th century Ned Kynaston (Billy Crudup) is a noted star of the legitimate theater with an unusual specialty -- at a time when it was considered unseemly for women to work as thespians Kynaston specialized in female roles and was described by one writer as the most beautiful woman on the London stage. With the help of his faithful dresser Maria Hughes (Claire Danes) Kynaston can turn himself into a striking actress in front of the footlights and is starring opposite Thomas Betterton (Tom Wilkinson) in a production of Shakespeare's Othello when while still in costume after a performance he is propositioned by theatrical impresario Sir Charles Sedley (Richard Griffiths). The sexually open-minded Sedley isn't discouraged to learn Kynaston is a man but he is bitterly angered by the actor's flip rejection of his advances. Sedley takes revenge against Kynaston by hiring a gang of criminals to beat him up. With Betterton's production of Othello closed while the leading "lady" recuperates Hughes sees an opportunity and stages an underground version of the play casting herself as Desdemona. While she lacks Kynaston's dramatic skills the daring of her appearance on-stage creates a sensation and King Charles II (Rupert Everett) a noted theater buff is so taken with Hughes that he declares women should play women from now on. But as Hughes' star rises Kynaston's quickly falls and he becomes a bitter forgotten man. When the novelty of Hughes' gender wears off and her failings as an thespian become obvious she turns to her former friend Kynaston hoping he can teach her to be as good an actress as he was.

Earle was hardly the only artist of note who loved Van Zandt's poetic elliptical songs of love and dashed hopes -- Willie Nelson Emmylou Harris Norah Jones the Cowboy Junkies and Nanci Griffith are among the many performers who have recorded his work and he was a key inspiration for much of the Texas singer/songwriter community including Guy Clark Jimmie Dale Gilmore Joe Ely and Lyle Lovett.

Van Zandt also had difficult relationships with his family and three wives and at the age of 20 he was given shock treatments which wiped out nearly all of his childhood memories. In the 1990s Van Zandt's public profile began to grow larger and he was signed to a major record label for the first time in 1996 but as often happened in his songs fate stepped in and Van Zandt died following hip surgery on New Year's Day 1997.

Many of them are naturally enough elderly and they seem content merely to go back to their former lives but their return causes a myriad of complications. Robin Campillo making his feature directorial debut co-wrote the script to Laurent Cantet's Time Out and his "zombie" movie quietly examines the individual and societal impact the dead have on the small French city -- just one of many similarly afflicted throughout the world -- to which they return. Isham (Djemel Barek) and V√©ronique (Marie Matheron) have their trepidations but they're generally happy at first to see their little boy Sylvain (Saady Delas) and the town's elderly mayor (Victor Garrivier) welcomes home his wife Martha (Catherine Samie). But Rachel (G√©raldine Pailhas of 5x2) a government health official cannot bring herself to visit her newly returned husband Mathieu (Jonathan Zacca√Ø of Seaside) at the ad-hoc shelter where the government houses the "zombies" like refugees. Eventually she relents and Mathieu returns home but the living find that their loved ones are not exactly as they remember them. Studies soon reveal that the dead suffer from a form of aphasia. They cannot create new memories and they cannot be trusted to perform any but the most menial tasks. Perhaps sensing the discomfort they cause the living the dead gather together at night and seem to be formulating some kind of secret plan.

Kelvin who makes no secret of his belief that Fogg is a crackpot challenges him to do just that and adds a wager to the bargain to make things interesting: if Fogg can't circumnavigate the globe in 80 days he'll give up inventing forever.

In February 2000 Pierson traveled to Fiji to shoot an episode of Split Screen where in the tiny village of Taveuni he discovered a fully functioning movie theater. A year later Pierson discovered that the owner was closing shop and moving to New Zealand. Fascinated by the prospect of showing movies in a remote community that was still edging its way into 20th century technology -- most homes have no electricity or telephones -- Pierson took over the business. Although the theater had shown American films since the fifties many of the impoverished locals were unable to pay the admission prices - so Pierson waived the costs thus enabling more natives to attend. He and his family stayed in Taveuni for a year and his friend Steve James (himself a documentary filmmaker of note) brought a camera crew to Fiji to document the final month of Pierson's experiment.

Justine Waddell plays the adult Natalie with younger performers Elizabeth Rice Candice Moore and Nadia Scappa portraying the actress in various stages of childhood adolescence and puberty. Although little Natasha Gurdin's Russian-born mother and father (here played by Colin Friels and Alice Krige) had drive and ambition it was the girl herself who energetically and enthusiastically promoted her career as a child star named "Natalie Wood" and it was Natalie herself who demanded that producer stop casting her in cute-kid and ingenue roles and take her seriously as an adult -- even before she technically was one. Naturally the film recounts Natalie's marriage to actor Robert Wagner (Michael Weatherley) the breakup of the union as she pursued affairs with the likes of Warren Beatty (Matthew Settle) and Wood and Wagner's ultimate reconciliation and remarriage. One might assume that the "mystery" of the film's title is Natalie's death by drowning -- to this day no one quite knows how she managed to end up in the water -- but it also manifested in the enigma of Natalie herself a woman who despite her aggressive and unending pursuit of fame and stardom might well have willingly given it all up just to be a wife and mother. In fine old Hollywood-biography tradition the movie boasts an endless parade of celebrity lookalikes impersonating such friends and colleagues of Natalie Wood as James Dean Edmund Gwenn Marilyn Monroe and directors Irving Pichel Elia Kazan and Nicholas Ray as well as several real-life celebs offering their reflections on the film's protagonist notably Margaret O'Brien Robert Vaughn and Henry Jaglom.

As the gay community sought to define itself it's not surprising that sex once furtive and approached with no small amount of fear and shame suddenly became openly and publicly celebrated and sought after and in a handful of American cities the gay scene became the center of a wildly celebratory orgy that lasted until 1981 when the discovery of AIDS led many men to reexamine their sexual habits. Filmmaker Joseph Lovett himself a gay activist who produced one of the first major investigative stories on AIDS to be broadcast on American television interviewed a number of men who survived the '70s for his documentary Gay Sex in the '70s which offers a sometimes witty and sometimes rueful look back at the discos bathhouses underground clubs and gay-friendly resorts which dominated the social and sexual scene of the day as well as the stories of the men who sought to declare their new identities through sex., Tom Bianchi | Scott Bromley | Larry Kramer, Heavy Petting | Beyond Vanilla | Folsom Forever | Fetishes | Meadowlark | The Boys of 2nd Street Park

A scene that birthed bands more concerned with challenging listeners rather than getting them out on the dance floor no wave was an attempt by frustrated punk rockers to eschew such traditional concepts as influence and rhythm to birth something truly transgressive and original. Though the music of such no wavers as Suicide Lydia Lunch and Theoretical Girls would ultimately be deemed unlistenable by the majority of music fans the post-punk elements of the style would later be adapted into a more commercial sound by such popular bands as Yeah Yeah Yeahs Black Dice and Liars. In addition to allowing the artists from each generation speak about what they believe to be the true value of their music Crary attempts to contrast and compare the decidedly anti-commercial sentiments of the original no wavers with the radio-friendly output of their millennial counterparts., Arto Lindsay | Lydia Lunch, Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten | No Room for Rockstars | Sonic Youth: 1991 - The Year Punk Broke | Edgeplay: A Film About The Runaways | Hype! | Echotone

Under commission from producer and screenwriter Zak Penn notoriously eccentric German filmmaker Werner Herzog travels to Scotland to shoot his latest film a documentary called "The Enigma of Loch Ness" which examines the myth of the Loch Ness monster and its role in the collective unconsciousness of the Scottish people rather than attempting to capture and photograph the creature itself. As Herzog is shooting his film another filmmaker John Bailey tags along to shoot a film about Herzog shooting a film using the provisional title "Herzog in Wonderland." While Herzog and Bailey ruffle one another's feathers Herzog begins to suspect Penn hired his crew more for their ability to generate "real life drama" on camera rather than their skills especially Kitana Baker a supposed "sonar engineer" who happens to have been a model for Playboy.

The film begins where Hideo Gosha's 1969 Hitokiri (the last film author Yukio Mishima starred in before his suicide) left off with the crucifixion and bloody execution of a low-level samurai Izo (Kazuya Nakayama). After death Izo's spirit travels through history and ends up in the present day where he finds himself among the downtrodden. Before long his sword becomes the instrument of vengeance and it seems he is seeking revenge on all humankind. Jumping through time and space Izo goes on a wild killing spree that brings him to the attention of Japan's eternal powers including the Prime Minister ("Beat" Takeshi Kitano in a cameo role) and the androgynous seemingly all-powerful Emperor (Ryuhei Matsuda). We learn that among Izo's various guises was a doomed soldier who had to leave his lover (Kaori Momoi) to fight in World War II. He spares neither Buddhist monks nor schoolchildren and eventually Izo confronts Mother Earth (Haruna Takase) herself in his (perhaps eternal) quest for bloody retribution. The film is loaded with cameos including Ken Ogata Ken'ichi Endou Susumu Terajima kickboxer Masato and K1 fighter Bob Sapp. Folksinger Tomokawa Kazuki appears throughout the film strumming his guitar and commenting on the action as a sort of Greek chorus.

One of Shawn's biggest fans is Shelly (Shelly Frasier) a cute but dorky Christian girl who works as a counselor on an abstinence hotline and has joined the frozen entr√©e club to be near Shawn. Shawn likes Shelly but is put off by her "wait until marriage" principles. Al (Allen Zwolle) Shawn's bass player also has a crush on Shelly and hangs with the club to spend time with her but isn't so sure about the band's new Christian image or his job as a combination clown/barber. Meanwhile Milo (John Angelo) the band's manager plans ways to propel them to Christian stardom while operating an anti-abortion coffeehouse the No Choice Caf√©.

Inspired by a stage musical which used to be presented annually at New York's Madison Square Garden this Christmas Carol stars Kelsey Grammer as tight-fisted Ebenezer Scrooge who sees the errors of his ways just in time to oversee the "best Christmas ever" for his long-suffering clerk Bob Cratchit (Edward Gower) and "God Bless Us Everyone" Tiny Tim (Jacob Moriarty). On this occasion the spirits materializing for Scrooge's benefit include Jason Alexander as a neurotic Jacob Marley Jesse L. Martin as a laid-back Ghost of Christmas Present Jane Krakowski as a sexy Ghost of Christmas Past and Geraldine Chaplin as a spooky Ghost of Christmas Future (in Wizard of Oz tradition three of these four actors also appear as "real" people in Scrooge's everyday life). Highlights include the song "Link by Link" wherein the ghostly Marley and a chorus of wraiths perform a lively ball-and-chain dance number and the outsized Christmas celebration in the home of Scrooge's first boss Mr. Fezziwig (Brian Bedford) which features among other things a "pole dance" by the Ghost of Christmas Past!

A smarmy lecturer (Alan Cumming in the first of his three roles in the film) arrives in a typical small town of the late '30s to warn the populace of the dangers of the "evil weed" bringing along a lurid propaganda film to dramatize his message. In broad unsubtle and hilarious strokes the movie-within-a-movie shows how even a squeaky-clean pair of highschoolers named Mary Lane (Kristen Bell) and Jimmy Harper (Christian Campbell) can become hopeless dope addicts by succumbing to the lure of marijuana. Reefer Madness is not only a savage skewering of the original black-and-white movie (some of the musical's campiest lines are taken directly from the earlier script!) but also a devastating attack on what playwrights Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney consider to be the real reason that the 1936 movie was made: to frighten the public out of their wits in order to keep them under the thumb of an oppressive government. Thus the musical manages to take a number of not-so-veiled swipes at xenophobia racism McCarthyism the Bush Administration's Homeland Security policy and even the recent FCC clampdown on "offensive" TV fare (one of the film's highlights is a garish nightclub number featuring Jesus Christ). The ebulliently staged songs include "The Stuff" "Down at the Ol' Five and Dime" "Lonely Pew" "Listen to Jesus Jimmy" "Mary Jane/Mary Lane" "The Brownie Song" "Tell 'Em the Truth" and the title number.

In 1994 journalist John de St. Jorre while researching a book on Olympia Press (the fearless French publisher who first published the book) learned that Pauline Reage was in fact Dominique Aury a well-respected and outwardly straight-laced editor for one of Europe's most prestigious publishing houses Gallimard who wrote the salacious volume for her lover another powerful editor at Gallimard Jean Paulhan. American filmmaker Pola Rapaport who was powerfully effected by reading The Story of O traveled to Paris to meet and interview Aury a few years before her death and Writer of O is a documentary which blends the story of Aury's remarkable life and times with re-creations of scenes from her best-known work., Catherine Mouchet | Alain Rimoux | Thierry deCarbonnieres | Barney Rosset, Fifty Shades Uncovered | Henry & June | Tropic of Cancer | Hubert Selby Jr: It'll Be Better Tomorrow | Bukowski: Born Into This | William Eggleston in the Real World

Born Bobby Cassotto and raised in the Bronx young Bobby (played as a child by William Ullrich) was raised by his mother Polly (Brenda Blethyn) his brother-in-law Charlie (Bob Hoskins) and his sister Nina (Caroline Aaron). At the age of 15 Bobby contracted a severe case of rheumatic fever which was expected to take his life; while it left him with a weak heart Bobby beat the odds and survived. Buoyed by a love of music passed along by his mother Bobby learned to play several instruments and began singing as he recovered. Displaying a confidence and drive which stopped just short of arrogance he adopted the stage name Bobby Darin and set his sights on becoming a star. After a string of hits as a rock & roll singer Darin (played as an adult by Kevin Spacey) takes another gamble and with the help of manager Steve Blauner (John Goodman) he reinvents himself as a supper-club vocalist in the manner of Frank Sinatra. All the more remarkably he succeeds and his swinging version of "Mack the Knife" tops the charts. Now a major singing star Darin decides to take up acting; on the set of his first movie he woos his female co-star Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth) and despite the stern objections of her mother (Greta Scacchi) Bobby and Sandra wed. But after a string of successful movies for Dee and hit records and an Oscar nomination for Darin the shifting tastes of the 1960s throw their careers off-track. Bobby cautiously embraces the new sounds of the day but his old fans don't want to hear him cover Bob Dylan or the Rolling Stones while the younger audience isn't interested in his new sound leaving Darin in a difficult place to make his way back to stardom. Kevin Spacey did his own singing for Beyond the Sea recreating Bobby Darin's vocal style with uncanny accuracy., Kevin Spacey | Kate Bosworth | John Goodman | Bob Hoskins | Brenda Blethyn | Greta Scacchi | Caroline Aaron | Peter Cincotti | Michael Byrne | Matt Rippy | Gary Whelan | William Ullrich, De-Lovely | Sparkle | Dreamgirls | La Vie en Rose | New York New York | Sparkle

Deserted by his seriously disturbed wife Ella (Megan Follows) dedicated high school teacher Tom Guthrie (Aidan Quinn) is forced to raise his mentally challenged sons Ike (Mick Hazen) and Bobby (Cody Arens) by himself. Cruelly tormented by their peers and shunned by many of the adults in the community the boys find a friend and kindred spirit in lonely old Iva Stearns (Marian Seldes) who offers to let them work on her ranch. At the same time Tom's fellow teacher Maggie Jonas (Rachel Griffiths) comes to the rescue of Victoria Roubidoux (America Ferrera) a pregnant 17-year old Native American girl who has been evicted by her mother. Maggie arranges for Victoria to stay at the home of the McPherson Brothers (Geoffrey Lewis William Andrews) a pair of crusty old bachelors who have never lived with anyone other than themselves.

The result is a meditation on the American dream and the manner in which diligence and determination can eventually pay off for the folks who aren't willing to let their dreams fade.

Modigliani (Andy Garcia) was an Italian Jew who was living in Paris in the 1910s when the city's bohemian community was in full flower. While Modigliani was a uniquely gifted painter and sculptor his friend and rival Pablo Picasso (Omid Djalili) had already found fame and fortune; Modigliani's work had yet to reach a significant audience beyond the city's creative inner circle. Though Modigliani stubbornly refused to compromise his vision for the sake of sales he was alternately troubled and enraged by the lack of acceptance for his art and was known to buffer his bruised ego with alcohol and opium which made his often unpredictable and sometimes violent behavior all the more volatile. Modigliani also had a mistress Jeanne Hebuterne (Elsa Zylberstein) who had been disowned by her wealthy family for falling in love with a Jew and having his child out of wedlock. When Hebuterne discovered she was pregnant again Modigliani faced pressure to marry her and had to face the practical question of how to support his offspring. Modigliani's fate rested upon winning an annual art competition in Paris which would have given him a needed influx of cash leaving him understandably enraged when Picasso also chose to enter a work in the contest., Andy Garcia | Elsa Zylberstein | Hippolyte Girardot | Omid Djalili | Eva Herzigova | Udo Kier, Surviving Picasso | Girl With a Pearl Earring | Frida | The Dresser | Final Portrait | Amadeus

Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) is a sweet if somewhat clueless man who shares his home with his pet cat Garfield (voice of Bill Murray). Garfield is not your ordinary tabby -- he's fat he's smart-mouthed he's arrogant he won't do anything he doesn't have to and would rather stuff himself with lasagna than do something Jon asks of him. Despite this Jon loves his cat but when he decides to expand his animal family Garfield is less than enthusiastic about the presence of Odie a lovably enthusiastic dog whose only flaw is his extreme stupidity. While Jon is crazy for Odie and especially likes having two pets that necessitate periodic visits to Dr. Liz Wilson (Jennifer Love Hewitt) a veterinarian he has a crush on Garfield decides to remove Odie from the picture. Garfield arranges for Odie to become the property of Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky) a television host who acts like an animal lover on the round-cornered screen but doesn't much like pets on his own time. While Garfield at first enjoys ruling the roost again he soon realizes the error of his ways and in a rare example of selfless and ambitious behavior hatches a plan to rescue Odie from Chapman.

Randy (Michael Pitt of The Dreamers) is a young prisoner recently sentenced to 25 years. His new cellmate is Jake (Stephen Adly-Guirgis also a respected New York playwright and the star of Todd Solondz's Palindromes) a hardened lifer. Randy seems despondent and is reluctant to speak to Jake at all but the older con gives him a book to read and is generous with advice. Gradually Randy opens up. He's been convicted of vandalizing an expensive car. The sentence was severe because it was his third offense. His other two convictions were for possession of large quantities of marijuana. But Jake refuses to feel sorry for Randy telling him that he was stupid for committing another crime when he knew his situation. Eventually Jake's friendly cajoling turns to bullying. By the time Randy's mother (Laila Robins) comes to visit him he has to hide the visible signs of Jake's abuse. When Randy's efforts to regain control of his prison life are thwarted he considers taking more drastic action.

The film focuses on the media's least covered topic -- itself -- in an effort to trace the process by which newsworthy stories are either dismissed entirely or distorted into something more politically suitable for the heads of various media conglomerates. It also studies how influential politicos became responsible for an industry that was largely created in order to keep political abuse in check. Among the interviewees include legal scholar and former L.A. prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi film director and author Michael Moore and Danny Schechter a former producer for ABC and CNN. Pappas also covers the expansion of the news media and examines whether the onset of competitive 24-hour news stations has actually led to a nationally less informed public., Charles Lewis | Bernie Sanders | Vincent Bugliosi | Mark Crispin Miller | Michael Moore | Danny Schechter | John Nichols | Jeff Chester | Greg Palast, Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism | Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media | Control Room | Sicko | This Film Is Not Yet Rated | Unconstitutional: The War on Our Civil Liberties

Head of the Godsend Fertility Clinic Dr. Wells claims he can use Adam's rapidly dying cells to clone a replica of the boy though the necessary DNA will only be viable for another 24 hours. The process in itself is completely illegal; not only must Jessie and Paul be forced to relocate but they will also be forced to sever all ties with friends and family in order to ensure the secret remains so. Within the space of a day the Duncans consider the legal and ethical implications of such a procedure ultimately deciding that their love for Adam is enough to trump the law and any high-minded philosophical questions. After resettling in an idyllic town near Dr. Wells' clinic Jessie is impregnated with the late Adam's living cells while Paul is given a beautiful home and a more than suitable job. Shortly afterward the new Adam -- seemingly identical to the original Adam in every way -- is born and lives a life quite similar to his predecessor until the morning of his eighth birthday. A series of night terrors is the first thing to disturb the Duncans' otherwise serene lifestyle.

The omega and alpha of the title refer to the fall of the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe circa 1989 (an event that christens the opening of the film) and the outset of the new millennium (which marks the conclusion). In between Reitz plunges into the world of the Simons - residents of the village of Schabbach in the Hunsr√ºck region of Germany - and investigates the myriad of ways in which events from their lives intersect with broader German sociopolitical shifts over the course of the 1990s. This installment begins with the youngest Simon son Hermann and his lover Clarissa renovating a centuries-old house on a cliff above the Rhine not far from Lorelei. As time unfurls Reitz cross-cuts between the experiences of the couple their parents their children and the workmen assisting with the home renovation and gradually reveals how a sense of national pride and unity at the beginning of the 1990s (coincident with German reunification) ultimately yielded to disillusionment disappointment and crushing awareness of mortality from individual to individual as the decade ended., Henry Arnold | Salome Kammer | Michael Kausch | Mathias Kniesbeck | Christian Leonard | Constance Wetzel | Nicola Schoessler | Uwe Steimle | Tom Quaas | Peter Schneider | Larissa Ivleva | Heiko Senst | Karen Hempel | Peter Michael Goetz | Patrick Mayer | Rainer Guldener, Die Bleierne Zeit | Encounters at the End of the World | Cobra Verde | Wings of Desire | Fitzcarraldo | The Marriage of Maria Braun

In the year 610 A.D. the city of Mecca had become overrun with criminal and immoral behavior dominated by crooked businessmen gamblers and drunkards. The Quarysh the ruling body that controlled Mecca had been overtaken by corrupt men who served the needs of the wealthy at the expense of the common people. The lone exception among the Quarysh was the forthright and principled Abu Talib (Eli Allem) who championed the rights of the poor and disadvantaged. Abu Talib was also the guardian of Muhammad his nephew whose parents died when he was young. A man of deep faith Muhammad prayed every day in a cavern on the outskirts of town and one day he was visited by the angel Gabriel who gave him the task of spreading a new faith to the world which would honor the one God who watched over all. Muhammad took this charge seriously and set out to tell the world of this new faith but the men of the Quarysh were threatened by Muhammad's teachings so much so that he was forced to exile himself to Medina in order for the new faith to survive. In accordance with Islamic law Muhammad is never shown onscreen in this film. Muhammad: The Last Prophet was originally scheduled for release in the United States in early 2002 but following the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 the film was shelved in the U.S. due to widespread hostility and misunderstanding toward Muslims -- ironically just the attitudes the film was created to confront., , The Prince of Egypt | Ben-Hur | The Ten Commandments | The Ten Commandments | The Ten Commandments | King of Kings
