In the aftermath of 9/11 Kyle decides to serve his country by becoming a Navy SEAL. But with each tour of duty he grows more detached from his wife and children. As the story opens we meet carefree brothers Chris and Jeff (Keir O'Donnell) as they work the Texas rodeo circuit. They're cowboys through and through and despite being notably older than the usual enlistee Chris pays a visit to his local recruitment office and decides to become a Navy SEAL. Later at the firing range he draws on his hunting lessons with his stern father to become an expert marksman. A booze-fueled barroom chat with pretty brunette Taya (Sienna Miller) soon leads to wedding bells and following the terrorist attacks of 9/11 Kyle is deployed to Iraq for his first tour of duty. There his reputation as a sniper who never misses makes him a legend among his fellow troops and earns him the moniker "The Devil of Ramadi" from his enemies. With a substantial bounty on his head Kyle makes it his personal mission to take out a sadistic Iraqi soldier known as "The Butcher" as well as an elusive enemy marksman with a skill to rival his own. The closer he gets to achieving his goals during repeat tours of duty however the more fellow soldiers he sees die and the further he drifts from Taya and their two children back home. It all leads up to a tense rooftop gunfight in a raging sandstorm -- one that convinces the sniper once and for all to make his family his top priority. Unfortunately all is not well as Kyle struggles to make the transition back to civilian life but he discovers that helping his fellow veterans is an effective way to do good and make peace with his wartime experiences., Bradley Cooper | Luke Grimes | Sienna Miller | Kyle Gallner | Ben Reed | Elise Robertson | Luke Sunshine | Troy Vincent | Brandon Salgado Telis | Keir O'Donnell | Marnette Patterson | Leonard Roberts | Jason Walsh | Rey Gallegos | Kevin Lacz | Jake McDorman | Cory C.

The film opens in a dark and desolate future that was set in motion in 1973 when brilliant scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) created a series of giant robots called Sentinels for the sole purpose of wiping out mutants whom he claimed were a direct threat to the human race. Although initially programmed solely to target mutants the Sentinels soon began eradicating humans who possessed the DNA to breed mutants and eventually any mortal mutant sympathizers. Desperate Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) devise a plan to have Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) send Wolverine back to the year when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Trask -- it turns out that Mystique inadvertently accelerated the Sentinel program when she was subsequently captured by Sgt. William Stryker (Josh Helman) who succeeded at harvesting her DNA to make the robots more powerful than ever before. Upon arriving in the past Wolverine quickly seeks out a much younger Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) as well as Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Quicksilver (Evan Peters) and together they help break a young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) out of a heavily fortified prison cell hundreds of feet beneath the Pentagon. Meanwhile with the help of Havok Ink Toad and Spike Mystique is already moving in for the kill. Although Wolverine Beast Charles and Magneto manage to thwart the assassination Charles and Magneto once again find themselves at odds after the latter attempts to alter the plan at the last moment creating a mass panic during a post-Vietnam War peace summit in Paris. And Dr. Trask still fuming from having had the Sentinel program rejected by Congress takes his proposal directly to President Nixon (Mark Camacho) laying the groundwork for an even darker future than the one Wolverine was sent back to prevent., Hugh Jackman | James McAvoy | Michael Fassbender | Jennifer Lawrence | Patrick Stewart | Ian McKellen | Nicholas Hoult | Peter Dinklage | Omar Sy | Fan Bingbing | Daniel Cudmore | BooBoo Stewart | Evan Peters | Anna Paquin | Lucas Till | Halle Berry | Shawn Ashmore | Ellen Page | Evan Jonigkeit | Adan Canto | Josh Helman | Mark Camacho | Alexander Felici | Jan Gerste | Massimo Cannistraro | Mike Dopud | Lee Villeneuve | Andreas Apergis | Robert Montcalm | Greg Lowe | Jaa Smith-Johnson | Alex Ivanovici | Patricia Tougas | Alain Dahan | Michael Lerner | Chris Claremont | Lenn Wein | François Paquette | Zabryna Guevara | Zehra Leverman | Angela Galuppo | Milo Chang Sigel | Kiana Chang Sigel | Kyle Gatehouse | Jean-Sebastien Côté | Stéphane Julien | Taris Tyler | Darryl Scheelar | Thai-Hoa Le | Johnny Tran | Gregory Hlady | Dan Quoc Thinh | Vladimir Aksenov | Jimmy Chan | Julian Casey | Robert Crooks | Matt Cooke | Tim Post | Jason Deline | Karine Vanasse | Jude Beny | Arthur Holden | Sean Curley | Susanna Fournier | Andrew Peplowski | John Moore | Moe Jeudy-Lamour | Harry Standjofski | Brianna Bone | Neil Napier | Jason Koehler | Miya Shelton-Contreras, X-Men | X-Men: First Class | X2: X-Men United | X-Men: The Last Stand | Marvel's The Avengers | The Wolverine

It's been ten years since the Simian Flu wiped out most of humanity and somewhere deep in the woods outside of San Francisco Caesar (voice and performance capture by Andy Serkis) and his primate companions have established a thriving village built on the principles of peace and community. Shortly after welcoming a baby brother into the family Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) is walking through the forest with his friend Ash (Doc Shaw) when they cross paths with a human named Carver (Kirk Acevedo) who impulsively draws his gun and shoots Ash at the first sign of aggression. As it turns out Carver is part of a human expedition led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) who along with the rest of his crew races to Carver's side just as Caesar and the rest of the apes answer Blue Eyes' desperate call for help. An enraged Caesar drives the humans away after realizing they are no longer a threat and decides to dispatch a small crew to follow them rather than yield to the pleas of his aggressive advisor Koba (Toby Kebbell) to launch an all-out attack. Instead he decides to show the apes' strength by amassing outside of the humans' makeshift community at the base of an unfinished tower making it unmistakably clear that the two species should remain apart. Meanwhile the point of the human excursion was to get a dormant dam running again in order to power their community which will soon be thrust into darkness should they fail to take action. Convinced that he could strike a truce with Caesar that would allow the humans to repair the dam which is located on the apes' land Malcolm gets permission from human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) to set out on his mission. Incredibly thanks to the help of his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and a few other key allies Malcolm succeeds. Still his truce with the apes is a fragile one and just when it seems that the primates and humans have learned to coexist in peace a shocking act of betrayal threatens to spark a war that will determine the dominant species., Jason Clarke | Gary Oldman | Keri Russell | Kodi Smit-McPhee | Kirk Acevedo | Judy Greer | Andy Serkis | Toby Kebbell | Karin Konoval | Terry Notary | Enrique Murciano Jr. | Nick Thurston | Jon Eyez | Laramie Shaw | Lee Ross | Keir O'Donnell | Kevin Rankin | Jocko Sims | Al Vicente | Matthew James | Deneen Tyler | Mustafa Harris | Lombardo Boyar | Mike Seal | J.D.

Later the performers name themselves The Four Seasons after feeling inspired by an unusual source. They add songwriter-musician Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) and the equation is complete; Crewe hears Gaudio's composition "Sherry" decides to double-track Valli's voice and helps create a national sensation. Later however certain difficulties begin to take their toll on the band - including financial problems inner rivalries and tensions between the bandmates and Valli's long periods on the road away from his wife and daughters.
