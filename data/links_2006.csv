On August 31 1997 Diana Princess of Wales died in an auto accident in Paris; despite the controversial breakup of her marriage to Prince Charles she was still one of the most famous and best-loved women in the world and the public outpouring of emotion over her passing was immediate and intense. However given the messy circumstances of Diana's breakup with Charles official spokespeople for the Royal Family were uncertain about how to publicly address her passing. It didn't take long for the media to pick up on the hesitation of Buckingham Palace to pay homage to Diana and many saw this as a sign of the cool emotional distance so often attributed to the royals which in this case was widely seen as an insult against Diana and the many people who loved her. Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by Michael Sheen) saw a potential public-relations disaster in the making and took it upon himself to persuade Queen Elizabeth II (played by Helen Mirren) to make a statement in tribute to the fallen Diana -- an action that went against the taciturn queen's usual nature. The Queen was released the same year that Helen Mirren played Queen Elizabeth I in an acclaimed miniseries for British television; The Queen also gave Michael Sheen his second opportunity to play Tony Blair after portraying the prime minister in the television film The Deal., Helen Mirren | Michael Sheen | James Cromwell | Helen McCrory | Alex Jennings | Roger Allam | Sylvia Syms | Mark Bazeley | Earl Cameron | Tim McMullan, Grace of Monaco | W.E. | Hyde Park on Hudson | Mrs. Brown | Anonymous | Amadeus

It's 1984 and Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is an agent of the Stasi the East German Secret Police. Weisler carefully and dispassionately investigates people who might be deemed some sort of threat to the state. Shortly after Weisler's former classmate Lt. Col. Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) invites him to a theatrical piece by celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) informs Weisler that he suspects Dreyman of political dissidence and wonders if this renowned patriot is all that he seems to be. As it turns out Hempf has something of an ulterior motive for trying to pin something on Dreyman: a deep-seated infatuation with Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) Dreyman's girlfriend. Nevertheless Grubitz who is anxious to further his career appoints Weisler to spy on the gentleman with his help. Weisler plants listening devices in Dreyman's apartment and begins shadowing the writer. As Weisler monitors Dreyman's daily life however (from a secret surveillance station in the gentleman's attic) he discovers the writer is one of the few East Germans who genuinely believes in his leaders. This changes over time however as Dreyman discovers that Christa-Maria is being blackmailed into a sexual relationship with Hempf and one of Dreyman's friends stage director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) is driven to suicide after himself being blackballed by the government. Dreyman's loyalty thus shifts away from the East German government and he anonymously posts an anti-establishment piece in a major newspaper which rouses the fury of government officials. Meanwhile Weisler becomes deeply emotionally drawn into the lives of Dreyman and Sieland and becomes something of an anti-establishment figure himself embracing freedom of thought and expression.

In 1945 World War II was in its last stages and U.S. forces were planning to take on the Japanese on a small island known as Iwo Jima. While the island was mostly rock and volcanoes it was of key strategic value and Japan's leaders saw the island as the final opportunity to prevent an Allied invasion. Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) was put in charge of the forces on Iwo Jima; Kuribayashi had spent time in the United States and was not eager to take on the American army but he also understood his opponents in a way his superiors did not and devised an unusual strategy of digging tunnels and deep foxholes that allowed his troops a tactical advantage over the invading soldiers. While Kuribayashi's strategy alienated some older officers it impressed Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) the son of a wealthy family who had also studied America firsthand as an athlete at the 1932 Olympics. As Kuribayashi and his men dig in for a battle they are not certain they can win -- and most have been told they will not survive -- their story is told both by watching their actions and through the letters they write home to their loved ones letters that in many cases would not be delivered until long after they were dead. Among the soldiers manning Japan's last line of defense are Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) a baker sent to Iwo Jima only days before his wife was to give birth; Shimizu (Ryo Kase) who was sent to Iwo Jima after washing out in the military police; and Lieutenant Ito (Shidou Nakamura) who has embraced the notion of "Death Before Surrender" with particular ferocity. Filmed in Japanese with a primarily Japanese cast Letters From Iwo Jima was shot in tandem with Flags of Our Fathers and the two films were released within two months of one another., Ken Watanabe | Kazunari Ninomiya | Tsuyoshi Ihara | Ryo Kase | Shidou Nakamura | Hiroshi Watanabe | Takumi Bando | Yuki Matsuzaki | Takashi Yamaguchi | Eijiro Ozaki | Nae | Nobumasa Sakagami | Luke Elliot | Steve Santa Sekiyoshi | Hiro Abe | Yoshi Ishii | Toshi Toda | Ken Kensei | Ikuma Ando | Akiko Shima | Mark Moses | Roxanne Hart | Yoshio Iizuka | Mitsu Kurokawa | Takuji Kuramoto | Koji Wada | Shoji Hattori | Mark Tadashi Takahashi | Mitsuyuki Oishi | Evan Ellingson | Kazuyuki Morosawa | Masayuki Yonezawa | Hiroshi Tom Tanaka | Mathew Botuchis | Yukari Black | Daisuke Nagashima | Kirk Enochs | Ryan Kelley | Jonathan Oliver Sessler | Michael Lawson | Taishi Mizuno | Daisuke Tsuji | Yoshi Ando | Yutaka Takeuchi | Tsuguo Mizuno | Mark Ofuji | Hallock Beals | Ryan Carnes | Jeremy Glazer | Ryoya Katsuyama | Masashi Odate | London Kim | Skip Evans | Wanliss E.

When the citizens and interview subjects of the Big Apple seem less than receptive to Borat's distinctively unrestrained approach and the curious Kazakh television personality stumbles across an episode of Baywatch while channel-surfing in his hotel room he becomes instantly smitten with screen siren Pamela Anderson. Now confident that the only way to discover the true essence of America is to travel to California and make the bikini-clad beauty his bride Borat purchases a ramshackle ice-cream truck in which he and Azamat will make their way across the Great Plains and on to the sunny West Coast -- all the while coming into contact with a wide variety of "typical" Americans. Within this loose scripted framework Borat engages in his usual misbehavior with unsuspecting strangers from accidentally releasing a chicken from his suitcase on a New York subway ride to a formal interview with Alan Keyes., Sacha Baron Cohen | Ken Davitian | Pamela Anderson, Ali G Indahouse | Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa | Sarah Palin: You Betcha! | The Dictator | Kumaré | Andy Kaufman: I'm from Hollywood

Moving between representational stories and images this meditation on life and death focuses on the concept of the mythical Tree of Life that is said to bestow immortality to all who drink of its sap. In one of the film's allegorical timelines a 16th century Spanish conquistador played by Hugh Jackman sets out to find the tree in order to save his queen (Rachel Weisz) from the Inquisition. Another conceptual story finds Jackman centuries later struggling with mortality as a modern-day scientist desperately searching for the medical breakthrough that will save the life of his cancer-stricken wife Izzi. The third and most abstract concept finds Jackman as a different incarnation of the same character-idea this time questing for eternal life within the confines of a floating sphere transporting the aged Tree of Life through the depths of space. Even more avant-garde than his breakthrough film Pi The Fountain finds Aronofsky almost completely abandoning conventional story structure in favor of something more cinematically abstract.

It's 1920 and Damien O'Donovan (Cillian Murphy) has recently graduated from medical school. Damien plans to leave the small village in Ireland where he was born to take a job in London much to the annoyance of his brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) who is an Irish loyalist and wants to see the British stripped of their rule of his land. While visiting Peggy (Mary Riordan) a longtime friend of the family Damien and Teddy witness a visit by "Black and Tans" British soldiers who supposedly keep the peace in Ireland; the soldiers turn violent and murder Michaeil (Lawrence Barry) Peggy's grandson when they discover he only speaks Gaelic. Damien is radicalized by the event and with Teddy joins the local chapter of the Irish Republican Army who use violence to drive British troops out of the country. While the IRA is a poor and ill-equipped fighting force their willingness to give their lives for their cause is taken very seriously by the British who step up their reprisals against the locals; the Black and Tans even begin directing their violence and torture against women and children including Damien's girlfriend Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald). In 1921 Britain attempts to end the violence in Ireland by creating the Irish Free State a compromise government which will give the Irish greater autonomy while Great Britain still retains final political control of the nation. Teddy sees this as a victory and believes it's an important first step to a truly free Ireland but Damien sees the IRA's goal as nothing short of complete independence and the brothers and allies soon become rivals in a battle neither side can win.

Parkin senses Constance's attraction to him and he's equally taken by her beauty; in time the two throw caution to the wind and give in to their mutual passion. Constance blooms through her lovemaking with Parkin and she finds his simple rustic individualism is more to her taste than the life her husband has given her.

Oliver O'Grady was a Catholic priest who served in a number of parishes in Southern California during the 1970s and '80s. O'Grady was also a habitual child molester who abused dozens of youngsters who were entrusted to his care and while his superiors in the church were aware of O'Grady's crimes as early as 1973 they opted to simply move him from one congregation to another rather than turn him in to authorities or strip him of his ordination. In Deliver Us From Evil a number of O'Grady's victims and their families discuss his crimes and the repercussions they feel to this day. O'Grady himself also appears in the film speaking candidly about his career as a sexual predator and recounting his misdeeds in detail. (After finally being convicted of child sexual abuse O'Grady served time in prison and now lives in Ireland where he is still looked after by Catholic clergy.) Berg also offers a look into the history of the Catholic Church and how its leadership has often protected those within the hierarchy at the expense of their worshipers.

In the process he uncovers not an objective black-and-white issue but a myriad of circumstances and sub-issues of tremendous moral complexity and ambiguity. He then investigates the sub-philosophies and ideas that belie each side with generous input and assistance from socialist Noam Chomsky and via interviews with Christian theologians and professors of bioethics sociology and philosophy. Kaye also gives substantial consideration to the violence directed by certain extremists at abortion doctors nurses and clinics. The director worked on the picture for well over 15 years and it serves as a prime candidate for the definitive abortion documentary.

While the spontaneous quip earned cheers during the show the Dixie Chicks soon found themselves at the center of a firestorm of controversy at home -- radio stations pulled their music from playlists conservative political commentators organized boycotts and protests against the groups and during shows the Chicks became the targets of death threats. As Maines and her bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Maguire weathered the storm they had things of their own to deal with including marriages childbirth and making a new album with producer Rick Rubin. Award-winning documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck teamed up to follow the Dixie Chicks as they recorded their 2006 album Taking the Long Way fought back against the accusations lobbed against them and struggled to hold on to their personal lives in the midst of intense media scrutiny.

Born to Austrian nobility Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is only 14 years old when she's pledged to marry Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) the 15-year-old king of France in an alliance that has everything to do with politics and nothing to do with love. Sent to France and literally stripped of her former life Marie weds Louis but to the consternation of the royal court he seems either unwilling or unable to consummate the marriage while their advisors clamor for an heir to the throne. Young and more than a bit out of step with the new life that's been thrust upon her Marie gives herself over to the pleasures of life in Versailles knowing and caring little of the political intrigue that surrounds her. In time Marie's trusted older brother Joseph (Danny Huston) is brought in to coach Louis on the finer points of marital relations and before long the couple is finally blessed with a child. However as Marie tends to her children in the gilded cage of her palace and enjoys an affair with a Swedish nobleman political power plays are throwing France into chaos and the growing ranks of the poor rebel against the royals and their life of privilege.

The picture ostensibly provides a thought-provoking investigation of photographer Edward Burtynsky's legacy with its aesthetic studies of industrial landscapes. But Baichwal's documentary probes deeper than a mere surface-level glimpse of Burtynsky's life and work. It uses the topic of Burtynsky as a springboard segueing from there into a protracted exploration of "the aesthetic social and spiritual dimensions of industrialization and globalization." Whereas Burtynsky's photographs reveal human beings dwarfed by the massive industrialized landscape that surrounds them Baichwal (much as Louis Malle did in his Humain Trop Humain) sheds a light on the tedium and monotony suffered by workers who are assigned small components of huge manufacturing processes and must endure the repetitive work that it entails. She and cinematographer Peter Mettler also travel to China and Bangladesh -- the corner of the world that serves as a destination for much of the West's industrial waste -- and convey the devastating impact that corporate disposal makes on indigenes such as the two young men who must wade around waist deep in toxic sludge while tearing ships apart with their bare hands. The picture thus raises some significant and sobering questions about the impact that we as humans make on our environment., Edward Burtynsky, Patience (After Sebald) | Long Shot Close Up: Andreas Gursky | Sicko | An Inconvenient Truth | Born on the Fourth of July | The Insider

Each year a student music festival is held in Kampala Uganda's capitol city in which children from around the country compete for prizes in performing traditional music and dance. When the students of the Patongo Primary School are invited to compete for the first time the children are both thrilled at their opportunity and determined to prove that in a place of violence and want creativity and talent can still take root.

Steve Kurtz is an artist and political activist who was an associate professor at the State University of New York's Buffalo campus and a member of a politically oriented creative collective known as the Critical Art Ensemble. In the spring of 2004 Kurtz was preparing an installation of pieces commenting on the potential dangers of genetically modified foods for the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art when his wife Hope Kurtz unexpectedly suffered heart failure. Kurtz called 911 to report the emergency but by the time the police arrived she was dead. While looking through Kurtz's home authorities found petri dishes used to grow bacteria and genetically modified flies the artist had obtained for his exhibit; soon a Hazmat crew had sealed off the house and Kurtz was behind bars under laws designed to combat bioterrorism. While Kurtz purchased his materials legally through the Internet and the case against him is flimsy at best the FBI has refused to drop charges against him in part because the federal government is eager to strengthen bioterrorism laws rather than call attention to their flaws and in part because the Food and Drug Administration would prefer to keep critics of bioengineered food (which the FDA has embraced over the objection of many in the scientific community) as quiet as possible. Since Kurtz is not able to tell his own story on camera for the film Strange Culture Hershman-Leeson has combined interviews and newsreel footage with cinéma vérité-style re-creations featuring actors Thomas Jay Ryan as Steve Kurtz Tilda Swinton as Hope Kurtz and Peter Coyote as Steve's associate Robert Ferrell.

Guy (Erik Steffan Maahs) is a house painter who at the urging of his aging mother (Gretchen Krich) returns to the tiny Canadian island where he grew up to put a fresh coat of paint on the lighthouse that was the family home. As Guy tries to cover the wear and tear of many years he can't help but think back to his troubled youth; young Guy (Sullivan Brown) and his older sister (Maya Lawson) had to compete for attention with the children of the small orphanage Mother operated while Father (Todd Jefferson Moore) spent most of his time in the basement working on his latest invention. When a number of the orphans began displaying strange wounds on their heads the island received a visit from Wendy Hale (Katherine E. Scharhon) a young detective who along with her brother Chase had become famous as "the Lightbulb Kids" the heroes of a series of popular books. Guy became quite infatuated with Wendy and when the teen crime-fighter disguised herself as her brother Chase Sis developed a powerful attraction to the "young man." As angry orphan Savage Tom (Andrew Loviska) leads a revolt of the youngsters Chase and the Maddin siblings began to uncover the terrible secret behind Mother's and Father's seemingly unrelated occupations. Shot as a silent film Brand Upon the Brain! was initially shown as a special presentation with live musical accompaniment from an 11-piece ensemble as well as three sound effects artists and a celebrity narrator.

DiCillo mainstay Steve Buscemi stars as Les Galantine a sleazy and merciless tabloid photographer from the Big Apple whose most noteworthy accomplishments are an image of Goldie Hawn eating lunch and one of Elvis Costello sans any headwear. Les is hoping desperately for his ticket in -- which he perceives as a prize shot of pop sensation K'Harma Leeds (Alison Lohman) as she's departing from a local club. He finds that ticket -- sort-of -- in the form of Toby (Michael Pitt) a homeless young man with serious acting aspirations who has a very brief exchange with K'Harma under his belt. Toby uses that exchange to finagle his way to an assistantship under Galantine and the two team up for a stakeout managing to swing 700 dollars for a photo of a celebrity who is recovering from penis surgery. While DiCillo cuts between the adventures of the two men and the vapid lifestyle of the untalented hack K'Harma Toby begins his meteoric rise to the top of the Hollywood trash heap by attending a Soap Stars Against STD Convention where he not only meets and impresses a big-shot casting director (Gina Gershon) but runs into K'Harma once again -- recently split from her beau -- and finds his way into her bed setting the stage for his own ascent to superstardom., Steve Buscemi | Michael Pitt | Alison Lohman | Gina Gershon | Callie Thorne | Kevin Corrigan | Richard Short | Elvis Costello | Tom Aldredge, Jimmy Hollywood | To Be or Not to Be | Birdman | It Should Happen to You | Soapdish | Funny Girl

Witnesses describe a strange charismatic young man who nursed a seemingly sincere desire for social justice but also reputedly murdered small animals as a child. Jones' desire to befriend people across color and class lines alienated his family and neighbors. Eventually he moved to Indianapolis where as a young Pentecostal minister he started the city's first integrated church. Eventually Jones moved his church to California to escape the racism he perceived in Indiana. In Redwood Valley his church took on a new life and he began aggressively recruiting new members. At first members were required to tithe a percentage of their worth but eventually they were expected to relinquish all of their "worldly goods" to the Temple. In 1974 Jones moved to San Francisco where he acquired some political clout before his high profile caught up with him. Just before a damaging exposé was published he moved his people to what was meant to be a "paradise" outside the racism and oppression of America in Guyana. Nelson interviews eyewitnesses including many former members of the Temple and members of Congressman Leo Ryan's staff who managed to escape when the congressman's investigatory visit ended in bloodshed.

The story opens with Capote (Toby Jones) visiting the site of the 1959 Clutter family homicide on a Kansas research trip accompanied by his close friend and colleague author Harper Lee (Sandra Bullock). As Capote settles into the community McGrath uses the preponderance of screen time to explore the emotional tapestry of Capote's increasingly risky emotional attachment to one of the two murderers Perry Edward Smith (Daniel Craig) with whom he senses more than a few common bonds. McGrath weaves a decidedly bittersweet tale contrasting the optimism and devil-may-care "conquer all" attitude of Capote in his early years with a seemingly endless string of poor choices in the writer's later years from addictions to drink and pills to a failure to maintain healthy output as a writer to poorly chosen romantic and sexual entanglements. Most significantly however McGrath reveals how the relationship with Smith virtually destroyed Capote as an artist and a human being by inducing him to sell out on all levels to satisfy his lust for accomplishment and notoriety., Toby Jones | Sandra Bullock | Daniel Craig | Peter Bogdanovich | Jeff Daniels | Hope Davis | Gwyneth Paltrow | Isabella Rossellini | Juliet Stevenson | Sigourney Weaver | John Benjamin Hickey | Lee Pace | Michael Panes | Mitch Baker | Grant James | Sheila Bailey-Lucas | Richard Dillard | Marco Perella | Bethlyn Gerard | Libby Villari | Brian Shoop | Brady Coleman | Lee Ritchey | Brett Brock | Brady Hender | Brent McCoy | Gail Cronauer | Austin Chittim | Morgan Farris | Dennis Letts | Gabriel Folse | Steve Flanagin, Capote | Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle | The Cat's Meow | Sylvia | Plimpton! | Biography: Truman Capote - The Tiny Terror

The Vietnam War was raging and the nightly news was filled with stories of failed offensives and massacred U.S. troops. As anti-war protests back home gained momentum it was the hopeful voice of former Beatle Lennon that served to perfectly encapsulate the frustrations felt by many citizens that the U.S. had gotten caught up in an quagmire from which there was seemingly no end in sight. There's a high price to be paid for standing strong in your beliefs and openly criticizing the ruling elite though and now through interviews with those who knew him best and revealing glimpses into an era where all hope seemed lost filmmakers finally uncover the truth behind the Nixon administration's highly classified efforts to isolate and eventually deport the man whose powerful words threatened to actually make sense in a world slowly suffocated by the grip of insanity., John Lennon | Carl Bernstein | Noam Chomsky | Walter Cronkite | Mario Cuomo | Angela Davis | John Dean | Bob Gruen | Ron Kovic | Paul Krassner | Yoko Ono | G.

It thus carries viewers inside of the "suburban mystique" via a protracted dissection of a clan that resides in a planned community the Moss family. The film specifically examines how the suburban landscape with its prefab houses playgrounds schools strip malls and community activities continues to shape and define the lives and perceptions of these individuals -- from the father's involvement with a local theatrical troupe to the children's feelings of ennui and sense of removal from the neighbors in their subdivision. Burns offsets the picture's stark themes and undertones however with a sharp wicked and occasionally satirical sense of humor that never fails to catch the absurdities or ironies of this landscape. Musician Joey Santiago from the band The Pixies complements the images with a gritty rock soundtrack that draws out the sense of familial dislocation and desperation. The picture also traces the rise of suburbia historically and features input by such suburban commentators as Mark Kingwell from the University of Toronto and writer James Howard Kunstler who criticize the initial postwar model for suburban communities and suggest that it may not provide the optimal environment for living and raising a family., Daniel Jeffery | Bob Legare | Jane MacFarlane | Ashleigh Fidyk | Curt McKinstry | Karen Jeffery | Mark Kingwell, The City Dark | The Pruitt-Igoe Myth: An Urban History | Free the Mind | Patagonia Rising | The Yes Men | The Yes Men Fix the World

In 1948 the South African government established a set of laws that severely limited the civil economic and political freedoms of black citizens a policy which came to be known as apartheid. In the 1970s and '80s as more Americans became aware of South Africa's institutionalized racism many began to call for the United States government to use its power to lobby for an end to apartheid. However the abundance of strategic minerals in South Africa made the nation an ally of many American corporations and President Ronald Reagan publicly expressed his belief that an economic boycott or other sanctions against South Africa would hurt the nation's blacks rather than help them. Many Americans disagreed and a grass-roots movement sprung up among politicians community leaders activists and concerned citizens that led Congress to pass legislation mandating sanctions against South Africa in 1986 -- and when Reagan vetoed the bill Congress voted to override him and make it law. The documentary Have You Heard From Johannesburg?: Apartheid and the Club of the West explores how Americans of conscience banded together to challenge their nation's support of a racist government; the film is part of a projected series of documentaries on the rise and fall of apartheid in South Africa., , With All Deliberate Speed | The Insider | Born on the Fourth of July | Capitalism: A Love Story | The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 | Sing Your Song

As the film opens a young woman (played by Luisa Williams) prays to an unknown unspecified deity then tucks away into a fleabag New Jersey motel room when several hooded men arrive arm her with explosives and give her instructions to carry out. She then takes off alone headed straight for Times Square and making her way through clamoring throngs of real people -- any of whom could instantly become her casualties. Loktev strips away much of the external exposition never revealing the central character's name ethnicity religious affiliation or political background. The director thus forces the audience to focus exclusively and unrelentingly on the nature of the character's actions and underscores the idea that terrorist motivations are on some level completely inconceivable to an outsider. Ironically instead of turning the central character into a cipher and thus distancing her from the viewer the film's stripped exposition terrifyingly draws the audience closer to the character.

Filmmaker Deborah Scranton gave digital video cameras to three National Guard volunteers who were called up for duty in Iraq and asked them to keep a visual diary of what they saw and how they felt about it. The three men who took Scranton up on her offer were Sgt. Zack Bazzi Spc. Mike Moriarty and Sgt. Steve Pink. Bazzi is a Lebanese immigrant who previously fought in Bosnia and Kosovo and loves the thrill of battle though he has serious reservations about the nature of the American occupation and feels most of his fellow soldiers are dangerously unaware of the habits and customs of the Iraqis. Moriarty is a husband and father who volunteered for service after the terrorist attacks of September 11; he's a proud warrior and loyal to his fellow soldiers though he's come to hate the sting of battle. And Pink is a carpenter and would-be writer who joined the Guard to help raise money for college; his dark sense of humor often rises to the surface as he confronts the uglier aspects of the conflict. Scranton took the footage shot by the soldiers (sometimes uploaded by Internet just hours after a battle) and fashioned it into a story of three different men united by a single cause who are fiercely loyal to their fellow fighting men and women even as they become increasingly cynical about the causes and motivations behind the war.

Near the end of the 18th century Francisco Goya (Stellan Skarsgård) is a gifted but controversial artist whose provocative and often satirical work has earned the enmity of the Spanish government as well as the Catholic Church who hold tremendous power as the Inquisition rages.

Under torture from Lorenzo Inés signs a false confession and her wealthy and powerful father Tomás Bilbatúa (José Luis Gómez) offers Lorenzo a taste of his own medicine by brow-beating him into signing a document confessing that his mother was an ape. Lorenzo flees Spain as his reputation lies in tatters and Goya earns greater infamy as he paints a wildly unflattering portrait of Queen María Luisa (Blanca Portillo) under commission from her husband King Carlos IV (Randy Quaid) but Inés remains in prison thanks to her coerced confession.

Twins Luke and Harry Treadaway star respectively as conjoined twins Barry and Tom Howe joined at the torso. They were essentially purchased from their family as teens in the 1970s by a sleazy showbiz impresario Zak Bedderwick (Howard Attfield) who planned to turn them into rock stars. Manager Nick (Sean Harris) kept the volatile Barry in line sometimes violently while musician Paul (Bryan Dick) taught the introspective Tom how to play the guitar and helped the brothers write their songs. A documentary filmmaker Eddie (Tom Bower) was hired to record the process. Their first live performance was a near disaster as the rowdy pub crowd didn't welcome the sight of the two young men coming on-stage with their arms around each other but Barry the charismatically angry frontman shocked the crowd by exposing the joint between them as he ripped into a snarling performance of their first single "Two-Way Romeo" and the legend of their group the Bang Bang was born. As the proto-punk group's fame grew Laura (Tania Emery) a young journalist came to write an article about them and quickly developed a romantic relationship with Tom causing friction between the brothers. The film features interviews with some of the characters in the present day and clips from an imagined unfinished Ken Russell film about the twins starring Jonathan Pryce and Jane Horrocks. The music of the Bang Bang performed by cast members and the band Crackout was written and produced by Clive Langer.

At this point Monir is separated from the group and they never see him again.

In autumn 1968 Britisher Donald Crowhurst the proprietor of a down-and-out manufacturing business for marine electrical components avowed to enter the first Golden Globe sailing competition -- a nonstop one-man circumnavigational race against eight other competitors. In financing the boat via a deal with English entrepreneur Stanley Best Crowhurst used his house as collateral. Relinquishing the voyage or failing to complete it would thus have instantly rendered Crowhurst homeless and driven his family into Chapter 11. But the voyage was doomed from the start: Crowhurst failed to finish building the craft prior to his October 31st departure but set sail just the same and thus sealed his own grim fate. Indeed two weeks after Crowhurst sailed out of Devon the boat began to leak substantially; recognizing that a trip into the Southern Ocean could spell disaster a desperate Crowhurst radioed home with indications of phony distances and falsified his logbook; he then made an illegal pit stop in Argentina to repair the boat and joined up with the rest of the competitors on the opposite side of Cape Horn in the Atlantic. When Robin Knox-Johnston won the overall competition Crowhurst and Nigel Tetley went head-to-head to win 5000 pounds for the fastest voyage; Crowhurst recognized that a victory would yield scrutiny of his logbooks and unveil his deceptions to the world; he thus intended to preserve his reputation by coming in second. He didn't count however on Tetley's boat capsizing -- which led to Crowhurst's own victory. Foreseeing disaster Crowhurst decided to end his life by drowning himself. In telling Crowhurst's sad story Osmond and Rothwell intercut narration from Crowhurst's journals archival film and interviews with the sailor's family friends and colleagues. What emerges is a portrait of a man sinking rapidly into a pit of despair as he comes face to face with his own darkest nightmares of personal failure., Donald Kerr | Tilda Swinton, The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition | Tabarly | Trouble the Water | Darfur Now | Gleason | Command and Control

Schnack draws from over 25 hours of audio-taped interviews to offer an intimate meditation on the life of the man who changed the face of rock & roll in the 1990s in this film that uses materials originally gathered for music journalist Michael Azerrad's book Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana. From his early childhood to his discovery of music and his troubled attempts to make sense of his skyrocketing fame as a member of Nirvana Kurt Cobain recounts his life in a series of previously unreleased recordings. By combining the interviews with footage of Aberdeen Olympia and Seattle -- three Washington cities that played a major role in Cobain's tragically short life -- director Schnack assembles a dreamlike journey into the mind of an oft-discussed but widely misunderstood legend. An ethereal score by Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard and Nirvana producer Steve Fisk as well as songs by some of Cobain's favorite recording artists including David Bowie and the Melvins merge with evocative imagery to strip away the legend and portray the subject as a real man whose talents stood in stark contrast to his ability to deal with the hardships of fame., Kurt Cobain, Last Days | Tupac: Resurrection | LoudQUIETloud: A Film about the Pixies | End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones | Joy Division | If I Should Fall From Grace: The Shane MacGowan Story

The Ground Truth was planned with a March 2005 release in mind in hopes of having the film in theaters in time for the second anniversary of the beginning of the war., Sean Huze | Denver Jones, Hell and Back Again | The Hornet's Nest | Gunner Palace | BattleGround: 21 Days on the Empire's Edge | Army of One | Combat Diary: The Marines of Lima Company

It is the tale of an actress whose personality becomes increasingly fragmented as she delves ever deeper into her work for a high-profile filmmaker. Kingsley (Jeremy Irons) is a director looking to adapt for the screen a Polish gypsy folktale that was previously stalled when the two leads were viciously murdered. Having offered the female lead to devoted actress Nikki (Laura Dern) Kingsley warns her male co-star Devon (Justin Theroux) to maintain his professional distance as Nikki's husband (Peter J. Lucas) is known to be notoriously possessive. As the passionate co-stars quickly cross the line and become lovers Nikki's slowly slipping sense of reality causes her to eventually become lost in her character while the mysterious story of a Polish couple unfurls and a trio of giant stage-bound rabbits (voices of Naomi Watts Scott Coffey and Laura Harring) lounge around on the sofa and tend to their domestic duties. Shot over the course of two and a half years and without a formalized script Lynch's hallucinogenic look at a doomed film project features all of the abstract imagery and strange symbolism that have long made the director a favorite of film fans who embrace his disorienting approach to unconventional storytelling., Laura Dern | Jeremy Irons | Harry Dean Stanton | Justin Theroux | Terryn Westbrook | Julia Ormond | Peter J.

The scheme worked for a surprisingly long period but when the time arrives to sell the business massive problems arise -- for the prospective buyers insist on only negotiating with the CEO in person. Thus the owner further extends the ruse by hiring a down-and-out actor to impersonate the chief officer. With Direktøren for Det Hele von Trier uses a new means of filmmaking for this film: Automavision whereby filming is done with an "automatic randomized camera" that selects the shots. It became a means for von Trier to "clean up" his approach to directorial work and reconnect with his own love of filmmaking., Jens Albinus | Peter Gantzler | Benedikt Erlingsson | Iben Hjejle | Henrik Prip | Mia Lyhne | Casper Christensen | Louise Mieritz | Jean-Marc Barr | Anders Hove, L'Associé | Nothing Personal | Birdman | Wuthering Heights | The Visitor | Citizen Kane

George Reeves (played by Ben Affleck) was a journeyman actor who had played a small role in Gone With the Wind and appeared onscreen with the likes of James Cagney Rita Hayworth and Marlene Dietrich but his career was not exactly booming when he was cast as comic-book hero Superman in a 1951 B-movie Superman and the Mole Men. A year later the producers of the movie launched a syndicated Superman television series with Reeves returning as "The Man of Steel." The show became a major hit and Reeves was a star at last. However on June 16 1959 to the shock of many Reeves was found dead of a gunshot wound. Police soon declared Reeves' death a suicide and closed the case but his mother (Lois Smith) refused to believe her son took his own life and hired Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) a private detective to find out the truth about her son's passing. Simo found that many Hollywood insiders did not care to cooperate as he researched the Reeves case but his digging uncovered plenty of evidence suggesting the actor did not take his own life and he also revealed one of Reeves' deepest secrets -- while he was engaged to marry a pretty young starlet Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney) Reeves was also carrying on an affair with the beautiful Toni Mannix (Diane Lane) the wife of Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins) a powerful and ill-tempered executive at MGM.

The filmmakers profile these individuals and show them at work trying to overcome the obstacles that the Israeli government the media and decades of ingrained antagonism have placed in their path.Encounter Point had its world premiere at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and won the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 2006 San Francisco International Film Festival., , Stevie | Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train | Promises | The Agronomist | Grey Gardens | After Innocence

The creation of author Jean Bruce OSS eventually starred in over 265 novels and seven cinematizations through 1970. The first seven film outings were sober and straight-faced; the eighth go-round (the first after a 38-year lapse) does a 180 to shamelessly poke fun of the rules established by the genre. A glib yet intelligent spoof it joins the ranks of Our Man Flint (1965) Aghaye Hallou (1970) Mad Mission 3: Our Man from Bond Street (1984) and other international pictures that glibly satirize the subgenre made infamous to Americans by Bond; like Mad Mission 3 it even packs in an OSS 117 (Jean Dujardin) with a startling resemblance to Sean Connery. The film's comic conceit involves making OSS 117 arrogant conceited culturally insensitive chauvinistic and thoroughly moronic (he pretends that various cultural institutions and religious practices for instance are nonexistent if he is unfamiliar with them); yet the character somehow manages to slide through outrageously dangerous situations unscathed time and again. The teaser prologue finds OSS 117 in Berlin where he outwits the Nazis by stealing vital documents from them hijacks an Axis plane in mid-nosedive and saves himself and the craft at the last yawning moment. Ten years later he journeys from Rome to Cairo where he investigates the death of a fellow agent posing as the proprietor of a chicken farm. His "side" activities during this jaunt involve hammering out a peace arrangement for the Middle East keeping tabs on the Suez Canal and monitoring the Russians.

That business was cocaine smuggling; as America developed a growing appetite for the drug Colombian suppliers found that Miami was a good place to bring it into the United States and a new breed of outlaws were more than happy to face the risks of importing cocaine in exchange for the massive profits to be made. At one time cocaine runners were making so much money that the city's banks were running out of room to store the cash and smugglers were developing new ways to move the product from floating tanks with radio tracking devices dropped into the ocean to cars stashed with drugs so well-connected drivers with tow trucks could haul them away and abandon them if necessary. The profits from Miami's cocaine explosion helped to transform the city into a major American playground but it also brought a criminal element interested in more than just dealing drugs as bloody reprisals between competing gangs of smugglers became commonplace and hitmen began working overtime to keep up with the demand for revenge. Billy Corben and Alfred Spellman are a pair of Miami-based filmmakers who were able persuade a number of key figures from Miami's '80s cocaine trade to speak on-camera about their exploits as well as law enforcement officials who struggled to keep up with them. The result was Cocaine Cowboys a true-life thriller about the underworld culture that helped spawn the film Scarface and the television series Miami Vice.

Erik (Andreas Wilson) is a commercial photographer and would-be screenwriter who has left his native Sweden to come to Hollywood in hopes of selling his latest script. Erik quickly discovers there isn't much of a market for stories about suicide in Tinseltown and he's looking for new inspiration when he meets Lola (Lolita Davidovich) a beautiful but wildly unpredictable woman who lures him into joining her on a road trip to Las Vegas.

Wilberforce was aided by anti-slavery activists Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour) and Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell); however pro-slavery hard-liners Lord Tarleton (Ciarán Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) spearheaded a hard-fought opposition to the legislation and despite Wilberforce's best efforts his bill went down in defeat.

Spooner became deeply infatuated with Wilberforce and she encouraged him not to give up on his noble goals; with her help Wilberforce launched a second campaign to persuade England's lawmakers to end the slave trade.

In 2001 American promoters persuaded five noted bands of gypsy musicians to join forces for what was billed as "the Gypsy Caravan Tour" but while these musicians appealed to many of the same fans for the most part they had never met before going on the road together. The performers were Taraf de Haidouks an 18-piece group from Romania whose lineup spans several generations; another Romanian group the 11-piece horn ensemble Fanfare Ciocarlia; Antonio de Pipa's Flamenco Ensemble which combines both music and dance in their performances; Maharaja a Northern Indian group featuring musicians from all sides of Indian society; and Esma Redzepova one of Macedonia's best and most acclaimed vocalists.

Sarkies however approaches the material not as exploitation nor as an action picture but -- like Terrence Malick in his 1973 true crime picture Badlands -- as an understated and detached drama. Sarkies uses a contemplative and reflective approach and a small-town pace and resists gratuitousness intersecting several tales of casualties and survivors and downplaying the brutal violence. One story involves the contentious relationship between fiftysomething Jim (Timothy Bartlett) and his mother (Lois Lawn); another has a mom Julia Anne (Tandi Wright) informing her daughter Rewa (Jacinta Wawatai) and her beau's children that they plan to share a house; and in a third eccentric gun nut David Gray (Matthew Sunderland) cracks and guns down Julia's boyfriend Gerry (Simon Ferry) in cold blood. These only represent the first three threads in a complex narrative tapestry; the story ultimately gives way to tense hours as the locals realizing that a predator is on the loose and will kill anyone he can find barricade their homes and cower in fear. Cinematographer Greig Fraser gives the picture a chilly wintry aesthetic rich with whites and blues.

Pressman Film Corporation Iron Films River Road Entertainment Vox3, Picturehouse, A World of Its Own, Life in the Arts | Crumbling Marriages | Mysterious Strangers, photographer, , Nicole Kidman assumes the identity of visionary photographer Diane Arbus in a film that draws inspiration from author Patricia Bosworth's best-selling biography to tell the tale of a once-shy woman who becomes one of her generation's most strikingly original visual artists. Diane Arbus was a typical wife and mother whose morbid interests stood in stark contrast with her decidedly conventional existence in 1950s-era New York.

He also tracked down and interviewed the friends family members and eyewitnesses to further recreate the events leading up to the incident and to try to explain what led these people to want to kill themselves especially at this specific site. The documentary's primary subjects all struggled with mental illness including severe depression schizophrenia and bipolar disorders and the documentary struggles to understand their illness while illuminating the anger and hurt of their loved ones. Most questions remain unanswered turning on the darker recesses of the mind. The shots of the bridge wreathed in fog turn the Golden Gate into a metaphor for a bridge between life and death sanity and mental disturbance and extreme isolation and connection with society. Though the camera crew worked with a set of guidelines including that they would call in someone they thought was going to jump the documentary still includes lengthy footage of the moments leading up to and including the suicides so discretion is advised for sensitive viewers., , Bridgend | 2:37 | Emmanuel's Gift | I Remember Me | Promises | Be Good Smile Pretty

On Sunday August 22 1971 FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Attorney General John Mitchell announced that 20 anti-war activists had been arrested in and around a Camden draft-board office. Just five days later the indictment of those 20 individuals -- as well as eight more who were accused of being involved in the incident -- was made public by Mitchell. Charged with conspiracy to remove and destroy files from the draft board FBI office and Army Intelligence office many of the indicted faced up to 47 years in a federal prison if convicted. While the accused referred to themselves as "America's Conscience" the government dubbed them the Camden 28. Many were surprised to hear that all but one of the accused were prominent religious figures -- including four Catholic priests a Lutheran minister and 22 Catholic laypeople. All involved claimed that killing was morally indefensible even in war. Over the course of the next two months the defense would present its case and many of the defendants would passionately plead their case. In this documentary filmmaker Giacchino explores the friendships and betrayals that played out as the controversial case of the Camden 28 went before a jury during a time when the country was divided by a war that seemed without end., , The U.S. vs. John Lennon | The Agronomist | An Unreasonable Man | Obscene | Reconciliation: Mandela's Miracle | The Take

Tabbak First Channel Kino Fox Searchlight Pictures Gemini Film International Tabbak Film Company, Fox Searchlight, Other Dimensions, Immortality | Trading Bodies | Vampires | Future Barbarians, Apocalypse body-switching butcher police protegé truce warrior, , The apocalyptic sci-fi thriller Day Watch (aka Dvevnoy Dozor 2006) constitutes the second installment in a planned supernatural trilogy by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov. As preceded by 2004's blockbuster Night Watch and followed by Twilight Watch this sophomore film picks up on the byzantine tale of a world where centuries ago the powers of light (representing goodness) and the powers of darkness (representing evil) called a truce. Each side set up a law-enforcement team to guard and monitor the other's activities -- the powers of darkness established and controlled the Day Watch while the powers of light established and controlled the Night Watch. Day Watch opens in the 14th century when Tamerlane a Mongol warrior acquires an implement called "The Chalk of Destiny" that can be used to guide the course of history. Eons later (in the present day) the Day Watch and the Night Watch are ongoing. Two Warriors of Light Anton Gorodetsky (Konstantin Khabensky) and his protégé/partner-in-training Svetlana (Maria Poroshina) quietly develop feelings for one another as they patrol the Night Watch together. As the story progresses the pair must respond to a distress call from an octogenarian victim of a vampiric attack -- an attack committed (as it turns out) by Anton's 12-year-old son Yegor (Dima Martynov) -- now a Warrior of Darkness. Anton must suddenly wrestle with two conflicting desires -- the need to protect his offspring by destroying incriminating evidence and his own desire to remain loyal to the Night Watch. Several additional subplots then unfold concurrently including that of Yegor learning to practice evil from his mentor Zavulon (Viktor Verzhbitsky) that of Anton "body swapping" with associate Olga (Galina Tyunina) and that of the relationship between a vampiric child Kostya (Aleksei Chadov) and his dad (Valery Zolotukhin) who works as a butcher., Konstantin Khabensky | Maria Poroshina | Vladimir Menshov | Galina Tyunina | Viktor Verzhbitsky | Zhanna Friske | Dima Martynov | Valery Zolotukhin | Aleksei Chadov | Nurzhuman Ikhtymbaev | Alexei Maklakov | Yegor Dronov | Rimma Markova | Anna Slyu | Igor Lifanov | Sergei Trofimov | Anna Dubrovskaya | Sergey Ovchinnikov | Anton Stepanenko | Elena Bychkova | Mikhail Gavrilov | Andrey Kuchishkin | Oleg Kshumanev | Roman Miryaev | Alexey Mitrofanov | Marina Stolyarova | Mikhail Tikhomirov | Yury Yunushkin | Marat Yusupov | Boris Moiseev, X-Men | The Crow: Wicked Prayer | The Sixth Sense | Cat People | Skinwalker Ranch | Paranormal Activity 2

It was during a weekend camping excursion with his sometime-girlfriend Jennifer Fitch (Shay Astar) and best pal Tim Best (Alex Frost) that Ray shot a pair of pretty campers simply to satisfy his own morbid curiosity and after bullying his friends into silence the case would go strangely unsolved. Despite the fact that one of the girls eventually managed to escape she lay comatose in the hospital for months on end before eventually succumbing to her wounds. Local detective Charlie Schilling (Michael Bowen) suspected Ray of the crime from the very beginning and now that the girl has died without being able to identify her killer Schilling is determined to ensure that justice is served. These days the womanizing Pye has turned his attentions away from Jennifer and toward newly arrived rich girl Katherine Wallace (Robin Sydney) and innocent Sally Richmond (Megan Henning) -- a recent high-school graduate who unbeknownst to Ray is involved in a tender May-December romance with retired cop Ed Anderson (Ed Lauter). Now as Katherine and Sally reject Ray's advances and Tim and Jennifer's once undying loyalty begins to slip the increasingly unstable pied piper's fragile ego spirals into an explosive tailspin.

Years after we last saw them Dante is still toiling behind the counter at a New Jersey convenience store and Randall is still annoying customers at the video shop next door -- or at least they are until a fire burns down the strip mall forcing Dante and Randall to look for work. Times are tough and the guys find themselves embracing the ultimate indignity as they take jobs at Mooby's a fast-food outlet where the burgers are advertised as "udderly delicious." While Randall's snarky attitude toward the public remains unchanged Dante is trying to make the best of the situation as he plans to marry his fiancée Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith) and move to Florida. However Dante's plans are complicated when he falls for Becky (Rosario Dawson) a funny and tart-tongued woman who happens to be his boss at Mooby's.

Deep in the snowy mountains of the American West a lone man named Gideon (Pierce Brosnan) basks lost in thought in the warm glow of a small fire. When a shot suddenly rings out and a bullet whizzes just inches from his head Gideon is suddenly pulled from his repose. His reaction is too slow however to save him from the impact of a second bullet fired immediately thereafter; a bullet that painfully lodges itself into the soft flesh of Gideon's tired shoulder. The man who fired these bullets is Colonel Morsman Carver (Liam Neeson) and Carver's goal is to hunt Gideon down like an animal and extract painful revenge for a past transgression that left Colonel Carver forever changed. From this point on there will be no peace in either man's life as a harrowing game of kill-or-be-killed is played out against the backdrop of the awe-inspiring and deceptively treacherous wilderness where the unforgiving law of the land takes deadly precedence over the civility of modern society., Liam Neeson | Pierce Brosnan | Anjelica Huston | Michael Wincott | Robert Baker | Ed Lauter | Kevin J.

Ricky's wife takes his fortunes while Cal takes his wife and now he's back with his mother (Jane Lynch) and long-estranged father (Gary Cole).

Aronson offers an intimate portrait of a band in which eccentric innovation and unwavering faith forms an unlikely recipe for indie-rock stardom. The year was 1995 and aspiring musician Daniel Smith needed a project for his senior thesis project at Rutgers University. Upon handing in an album recorded by the Danielson Famile entitled A Prayer for Every Hour the ambitious student was promptly given an A for his remarkable creative efforts. The youngest sibling in the Smith family was 11 years old and a new era in family history had been set into motion. Born and bred in the farmlands of New Jersey Smith and his siblings formed a band that soon took to performing in vintage white nurses' outfits to symbolize the healing power of the "Good Word." Though unfavorably received by the Christian community the Danielson Famile found an unlikely ally in the form of the independent music community. With an outsider edge that appealed to music critics who were fast beginning to grow tired of the stagnant state of modern music Smith and his band received widespread recognition thanks to articles in such prolific publications as Rolling Stone and Spin magazines. With little money coming in and his other siblings longing to continue their education and seek out their own paths in life Danielson Famile frontman Smith does his best to establish himself as a solo act while mentoring a then-unknown singer/songwriter with the curious name of Sufjan Stevens., Sufjan Stevens | Rick Moody | Steve Albini | Daniel Johnston, I Am Trying To Break Your Heart | Billy Bragg and Wilco: Man in the Sand | Paul Williams Still Alive | Kurt Cobain About a Son | Tom Dowd and the Language of Music | American Hardcore

The boys' periodic run-ins with a sadistic mobster type who rules the neighborhood Caesar Manganaro (Alec Baldwin) suggest the ever-present option of drifting into a career of crime. On the surface Michael courageously and doggedly bucks this choice opting instead for the pre-law program at Columbia and a straight-laced romance with blonde-haired blue-eyed coed Ellen (Mena Suvari) yet this path is not as antiseptic as it may seem for he actually scammed his way into the law program. Meanwhile Carmine idolizes Caesar and his desire to emulate this thug not only compromises his own moral integrity but threatens to jeopardize the stability of Michael's life as well by drawing him into a sticky web of criminal activity. While the first two men navigate these treacherous paths the third friend Bobby stakes out safer ground with a low-key job at the post office and married life with his intended.

While Moishe was a man with plenty of friends most of the folks he left behind to arrange his funeral don't have much good to say for him.

His son Ricardo (David Ostrosky) didn't much care for his dad and at the moment is more concerned about the unexpected pregnancy of his short-term girlfriend. Moishe's grandson Nicolas (Emilio Savinni) was forced to flee Mexico after being convicted on drug charges; having returned home he's become a reactionary Orthodox Jew with nothing good to say about Moishe's lifestyle. The local rabbi (Lenny Zundel) has his own ideas about how to conduct the funeral and mourning period which don't agree with Moishe's view of the world.

In the 1920s the leaders of the Church of Latter Day Saints began encouraging their congregations to form basketball teams and church leagues as a way to promote fitness wholesome fun and teamwork among Mormon youth.

In the 1970s Bishop Linderman (Fred Willard) has been watching his Mud Lake basketball team get trounced in the Church League championships for nearly two decades which doesn't sit well with him. Linderman used to be Mud Lake's coach before we was banned from the game for fighting and with the team facing another losing season he appoints a new man Dennis Buckstead (Andrew Wilson) to lead Mud Lake on the court. When LDS elders announce that they're putting an end to church ball and the upcoming season will be the last the pressure is on Buckstead to bring home a championship for Mud Lake's final season. But with a team comprised of myopic clerk Gene (Clint Howard) rotund Don (Chad Long) timid Thurman (Steve Anderson) half-pint car salesman Charles (Gary Coleman) short-tempered Mickey (Ross Brockley) and Borat (Sina Amedson) an immigrant who knows soccer far better than basketball Buckstead's prospects are not very good. Not wanting to disappoint Linderman Buckstead tries to recruit a pair of ringers for the Mud Lake team -- Moses Mahoney (Thurl Bailey) a seven-foot-tall prodigy who teaches sports to underprivileged kids and Jeremiah Jones (Stan Ellsworth) a fierce player who may be just a bit too competitive.

While Roy quickly becomes the target of school bully Dana Matherson (Eric Phillips) he's befriended by Beatrice Leep (Brie Larson) a spunky girl with enough nerve to stand up to Dana and her brother Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley). Beatrice and Mullet share their big secret with Roy -- they have a hidden hideaway where they look after a flock of wild owls. The owls in question are on the endangered species list but that's of little concern to Chuck Muckle (Clark Gregg) a top executive from the Mother Paula's All-American Pancake House chain who is planning to build a new restaurant in the hollow where the owls nest. Roy Beatrice and Mullet are determined to find a way to save the owls but Muckle and his right-hand man Curly Brannitt (Tim Blake Nelson) are less interested in saving the birds than in turning a profit. The kids have a plan however and they uncover some evidence of interest to David Delinko (Luke Wilson) a well-meaning but slow-witted policeman investigating some dirty doings tied in to the pancake house.

Miyazaki loosely adapted the work from the third and fourth volumes in best-selling sci-fi author Ursula K. Le Guin's infamous series of cult novels -- all set in Earthsea a Tolkien-esque fantasy realm. Gedo Senki opens at a point when Earthsea is deteriorating rapidly and the power of magic is waning -- tendencies signaled by the sudden frightening reappearance of dragons in the land of humankind. Ged Sparrowhawk was once a lowly goat herder but is now known as Lord Archmage the most powerful of all wizards. He soon meets Prince Arren of Enlad -- a teenage boy chased by a "shadow" the force that is tipping the world out of balance and driving innumerable people to the point of insanity. The men team up and journey to Hort Town the Earthsea capital city where they find the entire community turned upside down -- craftsmen have abandoned their trades slavery runs rampant addicts clamor in the streets. They ultimately find refuge in the priestess Tenar's palace also occupied by the scarred orphan girl Therru. While the latter initially avoids Arren in fear of his "dark side" Arren bides his time in the nearby fields being mentored by Ged on the balance of creation. Therru eventually opens up to Arren but he grows increasingly disturbed by nightmares about being chased by the shadow and his daytime fear of it grows absolutely overwhelming. Ged then discovers that the cause of the kingdom-wide "imbalance" is actually his old arch nemesis the wizard Cob who has opened up the gateway between the living and the dead and hopes to attain eternal life meanwhile plotting to murder Ged in vengeance for an act he committed long ago. In fear of his evil self Arren absconds from Tenar's palace -- actively fleeing from the shadow -- but ultimately faints and turns up at the castle of Cob. The latter's minions give their guest "hazia" which causes him to lose his bearings and tell Cob his real name. Arren thus becomes enslaved to the wizard. Meanwhile Ged and Therru turn up and bring Arren back to full awareness. With their assistance he is able to surmount the temptation of eternal life; he then does an about face and with the assistance of an enchanted sword prepares to do battle with Cob., Bunta Sugawara | Timothy Dalton | Junichi Okada | Matt Levin | Blaire Restaneo | Teruyuki Kagawa | Cheech Marin | Yuko Tanaka | Willem Dafoe | Jun Fubuki | Mariska Hargitay | Kaoru Kobayashi | Mitsuko Baisho | Takashi Naito | Yui Natsukawa, Howl's Moving Castle | MirrorMask | Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind | The Lathe of Heaven | Princess Mononoke | Steamboy

Documentary filmmakers Perry Grebin and Michael Nigro follow aspiring TV writers Gil S. Ripley and Dave Roberts as their failed Comedy Central pilot leads them to try their hand at reality TV. They start out pitching a show about N.Y.C. firefighter trainees at Randall's Island but eventually decide that they have to push the envelope and come up with something that has more of an edge. They wind up at the office of Kevin Blatt best known for marketing the Paris Hilton sex tapes and pitching a show called "Virgin Territory" in which several male contestants all virgins compete for the opportunity to lose their virginity to a porn star. Blatt responds positively but upon reflection he prefers an idea that Ripley mentioned in passing pretty much as a joke for a show called "American Cannibal" wherein contestants would be put on a remote island and deprived of food to the point of starvation presumably to see which of them would be willing to resort to cannibalism. Ripley and Roberts have qualms about it but it's Blatt's money so they begin developing the show with disastrous results. Grebin and Nigro intercut this narrative with interviews with reality show veterans like Dr. Richard Levak Jon Murray and The Daily Show's Lizz Winstead who discuss the phenomenon of reality TV. The filmmakers appear to be blurring the line between reality and fiction and rumors have circulated as to the authenticity of their story.

Willie Stark (Sean Penn) is a man of the people and for the people; at least that's what he tells the people. Propelled into a race for governor by opposing forces looking to split the "hick vote" Stark is convinced by a handler -- as well as by young journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law) -- to not kowtow to the powers that be. His rhetoric grows fiery and he makes his way into office on a not-so-solid foundation of social-service promises. When idealism gives way to the harsh realities of the time however the fast-talking politico is quick to discover just how far one can fall when ambition and power lead to a betrayal of one's original motivations.

In 1943 Edie Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) was born to a wealthy and socially prominent family and she grew up with beauty and money but also a history of mental illness; she was hospitalized with an eating disorder in her late teens and by the time she was 21 two of her seven siblings had died before their time. In 1964 Edie moved to New York City and quickly made a splash on the Manhattan social scene; she became friendly with the famous pop artist Andy Warhol (Guy Pearce) who was fascinated by her gamine loveliness and her quirky personality. Warhol wasted no time in casting her in one of his underground movies and she quickly became a crucial part of his retinue of "superstars." Fashion icon Diana Vreeland (Illeana Douglas) was convinced Edie had the looks and charm to also become a successful model and soon she was gracing the pages of Life Vogue and Glamour. But Edie's instability was hardly helped by her new fast-lane lifestyle and when she met Billy Quinn (Hayden Christensen) a folk rock singer-songwriter often cited as "the voice of a generation" he persuaded her that Warhol and his associates were simply using her fame and beauty for their own gain and she found herself torn between two powerful mentors one of whom had become her lover as well. Factory Girl also co-stars Jimmy Fallon Mena Suvari and Tara Summers as regulars at the Warhol "Factory."

Additional interviews with GM workers in Lansing MI who were handed their pink slips offer some tales that are tragically comedic and others that seems to reinforce the old adage about one door closing and another door opening while a visit to job fairs and "outplacement services" show just what the jobless endure on a day-to-day basis. Conversations with the downsizers as well as the downsized offer viewers a chance to explore the topic from both sides as host Gurwitch reminds viewers that sometimes the greatest success stories are born of failure., Tim Allen | Andy Borowitz | David Cross | Andy Dick | Tate Donovan | Illeana Douglas | Anne Meara | Bob Odenkirk | Harry Shearer | Sarah Silverman | Fisher Stevens | Ben Stein | Fred Willard | Robert Reich | Annabelle Gurwitch | Jeff Garlin | Judy Gold | Stephen Adly-Guirgis | Richard Kind | Jeffrey Ross | Paul F.

Mel (Matthew Modine) plays saxophone with a jazz band and the only thing he's ever pursued with the same passion as his music is women whom he loves and leaves on a regular basis. However Mel has decided it's time that he finally made a commitment to something besides his pet goldfish and agrees to move in with his latest girlfriend Inga (Ewa Da Cruz). This means giving up his apartment which Mel sublets to Ginger (Gina Gershon) a pretty but seriously geeky scientist who has come to New York from the U.K. to study the sexual habits of frogs. One day while riding a ferry Mel literally runs into Diana (Christy Cashman) a beautiful blonde wearing a wedding dress and he immediately falls head over heels for her. The fact Mel has been hired to play Diana's wedding reception (not to mention the fact Diana fully intends to marry someone who isn't Mel) doesn't dissuade him from trying to court her and Mel moves out of Inga's place and into his old flat. Trouble is Ginger refuses to move out and being forced to share the apartment doesn't agree with either of them.

Matthew MacFadyen is Gabriel Hunter a priest fresh from missions work in Africa. After 15 years of service in the field Gabriel returns to his hometown in Ireland to occupy the now-vacant pulpit. Once there he re-encounters three members of his working-class brood: his father Bill Hunter (Gerard McSorley); his younger brother the service station attendant Jim (Daniel Mays); and Jim's expectant wife Caroline (Eva Birthistle) who runs the local speakeasy. The family welcomes Gabriel home but from the first moments of his arrival he projects a violent hair-trigger temper; relentless psychopathic bursts of unchecked anger; and a sadistic obsession with inflicting pain and cruelty on everything and everyone around him -- from squelching live mice beneath his heels to strangling the neck of a chicken that he seizes during a cockfight. From the pulpit Gabriel uses sermons to relentlessly damn the members of his congregation for their sins including all activity at the local pub which he perceives as a den of iniquity. When Gabriel hears Caroline's refusal to have her child baptized the statement pushes him completely over the edge and triggers a string of increasingly violent acts that will bring the entire community to its knees -- and threaten the lives and safety of Bill Jim Caroline and the newborn baby.

Deputy District Attorney Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) takes his job in the halls of justice very seriously -- so seriously in fact that his wife and family see considerably less of their frequently-absent husband and father than they would prefer. When a case involving an animal laboratory finds the distracted dad once again taking an extended leave of absence from his frustrated family Douglas' luck takes a turn for the worst after he is inadvertently infected by a top-secret genetic-mutation serum that transforms the two-legged lawyer into a four-legged sheepdog. Though his current situation has its drawbacks to be sure the fly-on-the-wall perspective afforded to Douglas in his newfound state alerts the well-intending father and husband that all is not well on the home front. Moved by the unfulfilled needs of his neglected family and determined to become a better father if he can only shed his winter coat Douglas' unique new vantage point could offer just the motivation needed to bring the nefarious forces behind the serum to justice and win back his wife and kids once and for all., Tim Allen | Robert Downey Jr. | Kristin Davis | Danny Glover | Spencer Breslin | Zena Grey | Philip Baker Hall | Shawn Pyfrom | Craig Kilborn | Joshua Leonard | Jane Curtin, That Darn Cat | Ping! | Honey I Shrunk the Kids | Underdog | Turner and Hooch | The Shaggy Dog

https://www.allmovie.com/movie/klimt-v346121, Klimt, Avant-garde / Experimental, Biopic [feature] Period Film, Jun 22 2007, 96, Austria France Germany UK, , 4, , Raúl Ruiz, , Outsider Pictures, In a Minor Key, Life in the Arts, painting, , Raúl Ruiz's Klimt uses an amorphous nonchronological narrative to cinematize events from the life of one of the 20th century's most profound artists: the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt (here portrayed by John Malkovich). Ruiz begins with Klimt's painful death from syphilis and spends the remainder of the film transitioning loosely and freely between episodes that befell the painter. The film pays particularly strong attention to the artist's proclivity for scandalizing the European upper crust with overtly erotic subject matter and presentation and his many affairs -- notably a lengthy one with his perpetual inspiration Lea de Castro (Saffron Burrows). Throughout Klimt's life a figure known as the Secretary (Stephen Dillane) comes and goes who is actually a product of his fevered imagination -- and with whom the painter debates continually about the function of art in contemporary Western civilization and the relevance of the artist. This enables Ruiz to create both a biographical sketch and a philosophical treatise. Visually Ruiz and director of photography Ricardo Aronovich make the ambitious decision to recreate Klimt's style of painting on a cinematographic plane. Unfortunately difficulty befell this picture from the beginning when the director (for some unascertainable reason) opted to draft the initial script in French have it translated into German and then have the German draft translated into English and revised by author Gilbert Adair -- rendering the dialogue stilted and unconvincing. Complications also arose on the distribution end. Still infuriated by the distributive mutilation that befell his previous film the whopping Time Regained (and doubtless concerned that this might happen again) Ruiz pliantly struck a bargain with distributors for Klimt. He trimmed his original 135-minute "director's cut" down to a 96-minute "producer's cut" for general consumption which rendered much of the material less fluid and coherent.

Chris (Ivo Velon) makes a marginal living by sketching portraits in Washington Square Park and attempts to maintain an optimistic mindset despite inhabiting a city that has been hopelessly corrupted by greed poverty and rebellion. In the center of this swirling cesspool Chris envisions his teenage neighbor Lotusia (Diana Gitelman) as a symbol of purity. When the discovery of a hole in his wall reveals that the deeply disturbed Lotusia has suffered horrific abuse at the hands of her parents and is prostituting herself in a twisted effort to come to terms with her dire situation Chris resists the urge to reach out to the young girl and instead meditates on the Chinese symbol "MU" -- which represents emptiness and detachment. When Lotusia accidentally kills an innocent man while attempting to exorcise her inner demons Chris feels his morals shattered and sets out in pursuit of the frightened girl in hopes of finally providing the comfort that she so deeply desires.

Fairfax Furniture CEO Derek Abernathy has a problem -- if he doesn't manage to cut costs quickly odds are he'll be out of a job before he can blink. Desperate to save his own skin even if it means throwing his own employees under the proverbial bus Abernathy gives the go-ahead to outsource the company's call center to a small Indian start-up called Voxx. But technically Voxx doesn't even exist yet so when India-based businessman Devendra Tiwari and his son Ajay realize they have only two months to get the company up and running they send Nikhil Anjali and Reva to Detroit to familiarize themselves with Fairfax Furniture products and gain a solid understanding of proper call center procedure. Needless to say the current crop of call center employees aren't too thrilled about the prospect of training their replacements and quickly wage war against the three newcomers. Call center manager Carol is particularly miffed and wastes no time making the three visitors' lives miserable by sabotaging their training ostracizing them in the office and even rallying a local television reporter to her cause. With the lines drawn firmly in the sand and the three hapless trainees quickly nearing the emotional breaking point only time will tell whether Abernathy's decision to outsource will save Fairfax Furniture or backfire and bring down the whole company., Deb Tunis | Satish Shah | Marty Bufalini | Neil Bhoopalam | Ratnabali Bhattacharjee | Malaika Shenoy | Adam Schomer | Alison Crockett | Sid Makkar, Outsourced | The Lost Weekend | The Grapes of Wrath | Half Nelson | Broadcast News | Thank You for Smoking

In four "acts" of approximately one hour each Lee examines the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in the late summer of 2005 and the incorrigible response to the catastrophe from U.S. government agencies. The filmmaker then evaluates the overwhelming measures that must be taken for the area to rebound and recover fully demonstrating time and again that this seems an unlikely prospect in the immediate future. Act One covers the events that immediately preceded Katrina's onslaught of horror with an in-depth exploration of the Bush administration and FEMA's joint failures to understand the potential calamity at hand. Lee picks up this subtopic again and makes it the central focus of Act Two which expands into a dissection of the government agencies' failure to respond to the crisis with adequate measures; time and again the director fills his frame in this segment with images and indications of naked human indifference. Act Three plunges headfirst into the toll taken by the hurricane on the lives of Louisiana residents with protracted glimpses of the destruction wrought. And finally the film wraps with Act Four where Lee conducts more recent interviews with experts who question the soundness of the New Orleans levee system in the face of future catastrophes. A number of celebrities and public figures also appear on camera to provide commentary throughout the work including New Orleans mayor Roy Nagin actor singer and social activist Harry Belafonte and actor Sean Penn., Harry Belafonte | Terence Blanchard | Wynton Marsalis | C.

When the chilling events of the game begin to bleed over into the real world and the real-life deaths of the players begin to mirror the deaths of their in-game characters the race is on to defeat the murderous Blood Countess and ensure that other curious gamers don't fall into the same deadly trap that they did., Jon Foster | Samaire Armstrong | Frankie Muniz | Jimmi Simpson | Wendell Pierce | Milo Ventimiglia | Sophia Bush | Adam Goldberg | Billy Slaughter | April Wood | Monica Monica | Rio Hackford | Billy Louviere | Richey Nash | Maria Kalinina | Lauren Lorbeck | Veronica Mosgrove, Silent Hill: Revelation | Ghost in the Machine | Resident Evil | The Net | The Devil Inside | The Ring

When Freemont determines that the Emerald Tablet rumored to be buried with the Egyptian king will provide its owner with the power to rule the world Dr. Barakat's curiosity soon trumps her skepticism and the pair quickly set up a team of experts to locate the tomb and find the tablet. Despite Freemont and Dr. Barakat's noble intentions their efforts to locate and protect the Emerald Tablet threaten to backfire as nefarious archeologist Morgan Sinclair (Hyde) tracks their every move in hopes of beating them to the prize and using the treasure to unleash the ultimate evil.

It's the sixteenth anniversary of the revolt that removed Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu from power in Romania and Jderescu (Ion Sapdaru) is the host of a televised public affairs show who wants to do a special program on the revolution. Jderescu's idea is to bring on a handful of ordinary citizens to discuss their role in Ceausescu's overthrow and how their lives have changed since Communist rule was swept from Romania. However Jderescu can only round up two guests for his broadcast -- elderly Piscoci (Mircea Andreescu) who's more interested in playing Santa Claus for the neighborhood kids than talking politics and Manescu (Teo Corban) a schoolteacher nursing a brutal hangover. As Jderescu tries to lead a serious discussion of how Romania has changed since Ceausescu was driven from power the conversation wanders off on a tangent about where the revolution actually took place and the waters become even more muddied when Jderescu opens up the phone lines for questions from viewers most of whom have their own distinct (and strongly conflicting) memories of the Revolution . . . and one of which has a bone to pick with Manescu over some drunken insults he hurled the night before.

With this film Hong Kong native Yang shockingly details how the Chinese government ran blood banks promising thousands of dirt poor local residents 50 Yuan in exchange for blood - with contaminated needles and other supplies. A large number of participants contracted AIDS and subsequently died leaving behind a wave of orphans who became social outcasts. Many of the children then raised each other aside from a very few who were taken in by loving families. Yang enters the Yingzhou region and follows the plight of a number of these orphans including a particularly unfortunate one Gau Jun. Abandoned by his family he hasn't uttered a word since and is now treated as a pariah by surrounding communities. The film reveals how the little boy is taken in by a loving accepting family and given a second chance. But Yang reminds her audience that because of governmental irresponsibility many other less fortunate children exist left to fend for themselves who may never find adoptive parents and social acceptance., , The Bridge | I'm Dangerous With Love | Union Square | Emmanuel's Gift | I Remember Me | An Inconvenient Truth

Floating concerns Leonid (Alexander Yatsenko) a factory worker in a hamlet on the Volga River who gets laid off when the Americans arrive and take over his company. He then drifts aimlessly from one job to another from road repairman to market-based shoe salesman to plasterer. In time Leonid meets a female schoolmate and though their exchanges begin acerbically (laden with insult-swapping) the encounter eventually reveals a softer side.Khlebnikov's focus here is not on story but on developing and heightening a sense of utter absurdity drawing the film's flyspecks of humor from the utterly banal such as a woman's method of peeling a boiled egg and the sound of a door creaking.

Deraspe informs us that Pellerin vanished without a trace in 1990 after promptly burning every single example of his work. As she makes her way through the local art community interviewing Pellerin's colleagues family friends and enemies she gets wildly diverse perspectives on a man who some considered a hero and others despised for allegedly forging artwork and engaging in other sub-rosa felonies. But is Pellerin real or merely a fictional construct of Deraspe's picture? The film forces us to draw our own conclusions. As the movie rolls forward it remains unclear if the mysterious artist will ever surface and agree to appear on camera., , F for Fake | Exit Through the Gift Shop | My Kid Could Paint That | Abel Raises Cain | This Is Spinal Tap | Real Life

Jenks moves into the facility in June 2005 with assistant director William Godel and cinematographer Quickmire Pettigrew in tow who utilizes a tiny unobtrusive 24p video camera to document the experience - thus achieving candor and intimacy. The film not only observes the aging process and the state of institutionalized care for the elderly (most of whom are octogenarians and nonagenarians) but studies the burgeoning (and utterly unexpected) cross-generational friendships that develop between Jenks and many of his newfound housemates. The film introduces us to such seniors as jocky 80-year-old Bill Delarm who is initially introverted and laconic but who ultimately breaks down and becomes one of Jenks's best friends; 95-year-old Tammy Signorile a devoted companion to two other women in the facility; blind Libby Smith; and Dotty Shepard who sinks rapidly into debilitating illness over the course of the picture. Jenks includes many memorable sequences throughout including an instance where the power in the home cuts out during a lightning storm terrifying many residents. The final scenes of the picture witness Jenks departing with a firsthand heightened knowledge of the elderly and a grave sadness at the thought of leaving his new friends behind - as well as a concern over their collective physical deterioration. From outset to conclusion the approach remains sensitive compassionate and delicately-handled., Andrew Jenks, Pop | Youth in Oregon | Rock and a Heart Place | Time Indefinite | Assisted Living | Good Will Hunting

Seeking asylum in a seemingly vacant house the men discover that the structure is anything but abandoned when a vampiric creature surfaces and rips one of the men to shreds.

Flash forward to the present day in Swedish Lapland when single mother Annika (Petra Nielsen) and her daughter Saga (Grete Havnesköld) settle into their new home. Annika - a scientist - is appointed to work under the aegis of the well-respected octogenarian geneticist Gerhard Beckert (Carl Ake-Eriksson) in the local hospital. Beckert it seems was one of the soldiers in the cabin. Unbeknownst to Annika he has been attempting to create a super-race of vampires for the past sixty years thus enabling mankind to live forever - a task for which he hopes to win the Nobel Prize. As Beckert supervises and medicates a comatose patient Saga befriends one of her peers the street-smart troublemaker Vega (Emma Åberg) and accompanies her to a party. Several of Beckert's interns then mischievously swipe the pills that he is administering and one consumes the medication - which imparts him with a ravenous desire to eat his girlfriend's pet rabbit and to feast on pedestrians. The remainder of the interns then visit the party that Saga and Vega have attended and spike the punchbowl with the medication which turns the occasion into a menacing blood-soaked vampiric nightmare., Petra Nielsen, Children of the Night | From Dusk Till Dawn | Near Dark | Sundown | Innocent Blood | The Lost Boys

Clayton Driscoll was an assistant boy's basketball coach when he accepted his first official coaching assignment in the tiny backwater Oklahoma town of Middleton. An urbanite whose devoted wife Jean is wholly supportive of the move Clayton hopes that the peace of the country will give the couple the opportunity to start a family. Upon discovering that the team he is set to coach is a girl's team however Clayton's enthusiasm immediately sours. In the mid 1960s in the middle of nowhere girl's athletics could barely qualify as an afterthought to sports fans. The Middleton Lady Cyclones in particular were an unmitigated laughing stock. Though Clayton is at first flushed by the ineptitude of his young players his dubiety is soon tempered by the remarkable character displayed by the girls who want nothing more than to shine in the eyes of their coach.
