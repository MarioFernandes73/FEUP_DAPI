At the time Nixon sat down with Frost to discuss the sordid details that ultimately derailed his presidency it had been three years since the former commander in chief had been forced out of office. The Watergate scandal was still fresh in everyone's minds and Nixon had remained notoriously tight-lipped until he agreed to sit down with Frost. Nixon was certain that he could hold his own opposite the up-and-coming British broadcaster and even Frost's own people weren't quite sure their boss was ready for such a high-profile interview. When the interview ultimately got under way and each man eschewed the typical posturing in favor of the simple truth fans and critics on both sides were stunned by what they witnessed. Instead of Nixon stonewalling the interviewer as expected or Frost lobbing softballs as the truth-seekers feared what emerged was an unguardedly honest exchange between a man who had lost everything and another with everything to gain. In this film viewers are treated to not only a recreation of that landmark interview but a behind-the-scenes look at the power struggles that led up to it as well.

After Adele whisks Olive off to Europe but demonstrates no sign of returning soon Caden drifts into a series of relationships with lovers - first with box office employee Hazel (Samantha Morton) who purchases and moves into a house that is perpetually on fire; then with Tammy (Emily Watson) an actress assigned to play Hazel in the theatrical project; and subsequently with others.

Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) is a minor minister of international development with the British government who in the midst of a radio interview casually tells a reporter "war is unforeseeable." However the prime minister is being pressured to commit British troops to support American forces in the Middle East and communications director Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi) goes into a tirade when the press turns Foster's passing comment into a major news story. Foster becomes an unwitting media figure and he and his personal communications director Judy (Gina McKee) are joined by political damage control expert Toby (Chris Addison) as they're sent to Washington D.C. to meet with American political and military leaders. Despite Judy's and Toby's help Foster displays a stubborn inability to say what he's supposed to and he finds himself caught in the middle between pro-war factions -- including diplomat Karen Clarke (Mimi Kennedy) and State Department official Linton Barwick (David Rasche) -- and those who oppose the conflict including Pentagon attaché General Miller (James Gandolfini) and activist Liza (Anna Chlumsky). As if matters weren't already complicated enough Liza used to date Toby when they were college students and Gen. Miller was once involved with Clarke adding bitter romantic history to an already rocky playing field.

Marking examines the show's audience -- it's estimated that a third of the nation watches it regularly -- as well as several top contestants including would-be teen-pop sensation Rafi; Hammeed a singer who is seen as a champion and role model by fellow members of the Hazara people; Lima who was born and raised in a community of Islamic fundamentalists and must hide her identity for the safety of her family; and Setara an attractive woman who defies convention by wearing American-style clothes and makeup moving to the music on-stage and even abandoning her head scarf during a performance making her a hero to youngsters and a pariah to their parents (as well as Islamic conservatives).

King among others. Many of the American musicians performing at Zaire '74 had been emboldened by the American Civil Rights movement and saw their journey to Africa as a unique opportunity not just to perform for a new set of enthusiastic fans but to explore their roots as well. However while the forward-thinking promoters of Zaire '74 hired a talented team of documentary filmmakers to capture everything from the setup to the performances to everyday life in Kinshasa the project ran into trouble when the Liberian investment group that financed the festival and film ran into some rather serious legal disputes. For the next three decades the remarkable footage would sit untouched and unedited -- a valuable sociohistorical artifact seemingly forgotten and left to succumb to the ravages of time. Later in 1996 the rights were settled in order to help facilitate the completion of When We Were Kings an Academy Award-winning documentary focusing on the very same Ali/Foreman match that took place alongside the Zaire '74 music festival. Recognizing the need to assemble the neglected Zaire '74 footage while it was still possible When We Were Kings editor Jeffrey Levy-Hinte made it his own personal mission to see the long gestating project through to completion. The result is not simply a concert film featuring some of the most popular African and American musicians of the era but also a pure cinéma vérité glimpse into a time when the musical crossover between the two nations was just beginning to emerge., Muhammad Ali | James Brown | B.B.

John Halder is a professor of literature. When he's not teaching most of John's time is dedicated to looking after his neurotic wife tending to the couple's two young children and caring for his elderly mother who suffers from senile dementia. Disheartened by his mother's downward spiral John authors a novel supporting euthanasia for the terminally ill. Much to John's surprise the Nazi party singles out his tome as the "way forward" and soon begins to heap flattery on the author in the form of glowing compliments and extravagant gifts. As a result John finds himself making a variety of minor moral compromises that soon begin to snowball. As his moral compass becomes less and less reliable and music manifests in John's conscience at the most inopportune moments -- such as the time a Bavarian boy choir bursts in as he's attempting to seduce a young lover -- the author begins to question his own motivations while also taking pause to consult with his best friend a Jewish psychoanalyst named Maurice (Jason Isaacs). Unfortunately for Maurice the situation is quickly worsening for the Jews of Germany as John continues his ascent in the party ranks. While John does everything within his power to save Maurice the risks involved in truly removing his old friend from harm's way may already be too great for the morally compromised author to consider., Viggo Mortensen | Jason Isaacs | Jodie Whittaker | Mark Strong | Steven Mackintosh | Gemma Jones | Anastasia Hille | Ruth Gemmell | Ralph Riach | Steven Elder | Kevin Doyle | David de Keyser | Guy Henry | Adrian Schiller | Rick Warden | Charles Condou | Declan Hannigan | Kelly Wenham | Paul Brennan | Matt Devere, Far From Men | Julius Caesar | Spotlight | Lincoln | The Right Stuff | All the King's Men

Among those rebels is Argentine doctor Ernesto "Che" Guevara (Benicio Del Toro) a man who shares Castro's dream of overthrowing corrupt dictator Fulgencio Batista. As the struggle gets under way Guevara proves an indispensable part of the revolution due to his firm grasp on the concepts of guerilla warfare. Guevara is heartily embraced by both his comrades and the Cuban people and quickly rises through the ranks to become first a commander and ultimately a revolutionary hero. Part 2 of the saga begins with Guevara at the absolute peak of his fame and power. Disappearing suddenly Guevara subsequently resurfaces in Bolivia to organize a modest group of Cuban comrades and Bolivian recruits in preparation for the Latin American Revolution.

Frenchwoman Séraphine Louis (Moreau) aka Séraphine de Senlis lived from 1864 to 1942. Though ostensibly a shepherdess and housekeeper whose chief duties involved cooking cleaning and ironing in her off-hours Séraphine joyously turned to natural elements of the outdoor world with which she felt a tremendous degree of emotional and spiritual communion. Séraphine channeled these undying passions through painting and having only the scantest materials at hand created paints from elements such as animal blood oil from church candles and dirt pulled from the ground. With these crude and raw tools the nascent budding artist created tableaux of floral arrangements utterly unlike any seen before. Sadly those around Séraphine perceived the paintings as coarse and unimpressive -- something of a joke. Her life took a most fantastic turn then when Wilhelm Uhde (Ulrich Tukur) a German art critic turned up in Senlis -- and laid eyes on the young woman's creations for the first time. Yet despite the success that Uhde brought to Séraphine a sad future still lay ahead for the young woman -- one accompanied by continued obscurity and emotional isolation., Yolande Moreau | Ulrich Tukur | Anne Bennent | Genevieve Mnich | Nico Rogner | Serge Lariviere | Francoise Lebrun, Voyage en Chine | Iris | The Mill & the Cross | The Magnificent Ambersons | Citizen Kane | Gone With the Wind

By exposing the comfortable relationships between business and government Kenner gradually shines light on the dark underbelly of the American food industry. The USDA and FDA are supposed to protect the public so why is it that both government regulatory agencies have been complicit in allowing corporations to put profit ahead of consumer health the American farmer worker safety and even the environment? As chicken breasts get bigger and tomatoes are genetically engineered not to go bad 73000 Americans fall ill from powerful new strains of E. coli every year obesity levels are skyrocketing and adult diabetes has reached epidemic proportions. Perhaps if the general public knew how corporations use exploited laws and subsidies to create powerful monopolies the outrage would be enough to make us think more carefully about the food we put into our bodies., Eric Schlosser | Michael Pollan, The Future of Food | Food Matters | King Corn | Our Daily Bread | Bad Seed: The Truth About Our Food | Super Size Me

Stern, Endgame Entertainment Vienna Waits, Sony Pictures Classics, Only Human, Actor's Life | Big Break | Dancer's Life, audition behind-the-scenes dancer musical [play] rehearsal stage-show, , The central premise of the Kirkwood-Dante-Kleban-Hamlisch Broadway musical A Chorus Line is by now overly familiar examining as it does the 17 actors auditioning for spots in a chorus line on the Great White Way. Recalling Donn Pennebaker's Moon Over Broadway and other similar efforts documentarians Adam Del Deo and James D. Stern's film Every Little Step travels behind the scenes of the auditions for 2006 revival of A Chorus Line to investigate the goings-on and the interplay among the hopefuls. The film thus establishes a neat corollary between the events of the play itself and the offstage experiences of the aspiring tryouts. On top of this Stern and Del Deo work in a layer that pertains to the original genesis of the show and its evolution from an idea by Michael Bennett who recorded an ensemble of dancers speaking confessionally and used that as the basis for everything else. Here the filmmakers play those original tapes back on-camera thus resurrecting old ghosts; score composer Marvin Hamlisch also turns up and revokes the past courtesy of a revealing and racy little nugget about the history of the tune "Dance: Ten; Looks: Three." Above all else the film works in extensive footage of the auditions themselves on songs such as "At the Ballet" and "I Can Do That" -- thus interweaving an aura of suspense throughout the narrative over who will eventually wind up in the production itself. The title of the documentary of course is a reference to the lyric of the seminal tune "One" ("One singular sensation every little step she takes")., Donna McKechnie | Charlotte D'amboise | Marvin Hamlisch, A Chorus Line | Never Stand Still: Dancing at Jacob's Pillow | First Position | JIG | Moon Over Broadway | Company

Thure Lindhardt and Mads Mikkelsen star respectively as Flame and Citron. As two members of the anti-Nazi Danish resistance during the Second World War their activities predominantly consist of hunting down and rubbing out Denmark's most prominent Nazi collaborators and thus furthering the way for the Allied cause. Although Madsen opts for conventional subject matter here and even a traditional perspective given his film's anti-Nazi stance his deglamorized presentation retains a certain uniqueness with the two main characters presented not as conventional heroes but thoroughly desperate characters from the dregs of society with nothing left to lose except for their own lives -- and sociopaths prone to the most sadistic acts of ultraviolence against the enemy. Citron fares worst as an utterly irredeemable alcoholic and drug addict crumbling beneath the weight of a miserable rotten marriage and a less-than-glowing relationship with his young daughter.

Working in some of the poorest and most devastated corners of the globe the men and women of Doctors Without Borders are willing to travel wherever they are needed remaining nonpartisan when working in a nation at war and providing care for all who need it regardless of religious political or national affiliation. Filmmaker Mark Hopkins has created a powerful look at this organization and the people who make it work in the documentary Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders. While a large number of medical professionals volunteer to work with DWB the Paris-based organization accepts only a small percentage having learned through experience that the demands of working in the midst of war natural disaster or an epidemic is more than many of them are able to deal with. And while the film documents the group's many successes around the world Hopkins and the healers he profiles are clearly aware of the high stakes they deal with and that doing the right thing is sometimes an uphill battle with fewer rewards than one might hope.

Mike demonstrates an unwavering commitment to his craft and draws a cadre of defiantly loyal pupils including Joe (Max Martini) an LAPD cop.

The dedicated martial artist's fate takes an unanticipated turn however one evening when a young woman named Laura (Emily Mortimer) bursts into the academy in a state of near hysteria and reaches for a policeman's gun when he tries to restrain her. One thing leads to another and before long Laura is regularly receiving martial arts lessons from Mike. As master begins to teach pupil and his martial arts philosophies emerge his path also crisscrosses with that of a Hollywood movie star Chet Frank (Tim Allen) when he saves the fellow from a beating at a local club and gets invited (along with Sondra) to Chet's house for dinner. Chet extends gestures of friendship and Mike's guard breaks down; he speaks openly and candidly of a special martial arts method he employs that requires one of the participants to "assume a handicap." In time the association with Chet leads to involvement in the motion-picture industry and relations with a bevy of characters who aren't exactly what they seem -- including a pay-per-view fight mogul (Ricky Jay) and Chet's slimy and manipulative manager (Joe Mantegna)., Chiwetel Ejiofor | Emily Mortimer | Alice Braga | Tim Allen | Joe Mantegna | Rodrigo Santoro | Ricky Jay | Max Martini | Matt Cable | Jose Pablo Cantillo | Rebecca Pidgeon | Luciana Souza | Randy Couture | Cathy Cahlin Ryan | Cyril Takayama | Matt Malloy | Scott Barry | John Machado | Jack Wallace | Jake Johnson | Dennis Keefer | Robert Reinis | Dominic Hoffman | David Paymer | Kimko | Jennifer Grey | Linda Kimbrough | Steve DeCastro | Ed O'Neill | Enson Inoue | Allison Karman | Damon Herriman | Renato Magno | Rico Chiapparelli | Martin Desideriom | Gilbert Gomez | Kei Hirayama | Vincent Guastaferro | Mike Goldberg | Jean Jacques Machado | Josh Rafferty | J.J.

Still Göran recognizes that Patrik needs a home and agrees to put the openly hostile boy up until he and Sven can find a more suitable place for him to live. But former street punk Sven isn't quite as accommodating due to the fact that he knows well what a young ruffian such as Patrik may be capable of.

Perhaps due to the morose surroundings in which he was raised wide-eyed Edward (Son of Rambow star Bill Milner) possesses both an acute sense of death and an obsessive desire to find out what happens after we pass on from this life. These interests are most noticeably evident in Edward's ongoing fascination with the paranormal an obsession that his overworked parents merely tolerate as the curious boy makes his way around the hospice with a tape recorder determined to better understand the concept of mortality. Suddenly into Edward's world rolls embittered burned-out ex-magician Clarence (Michael Caine) -- who makes no attempts to hide the fact that he's not in the hospice by his own free will. Clarence has long since ceased to practice his trade and no longer possesses the ability to recognize anything positive in either his surroundings or the people who inhabit them. He's irascible ornery and indignant and he's just barely able to tolerate the young boy who's so interested in the one topic that plagues his thoughts most -- death. Before long however these two outsiders discover that their mutual need to make sense of the world means they have more in common than initial appearances would suggest. Soon embarking on a series of comic misadventures that help them both to better understand the many mysteries of life Edward and Clarence form an unlikely bond that provides them both with the comfort they so desperately need during this uncertain stage in each of their lives., Michael Caine | Anne-Marie Duff | David Morrissey | Rosemary Harris | Elizabeth Spriggs | Bill Milner | Leslie Phillips | Peter Vaughan | Linzey Cocker | Michael Keogh | Ralph Ineson | Sylvia Syms | Garick Hagon | Miles Jupp | Thelma Barlow | Ralph Riach | Angie Inwards | David Rintoul, Le Vieil Homme et l'Enfant | Kotch | I'm Going Home | Forrest Gump | Lost in Translation | Hesher

Harvey (Hoffman) is about to lose his unfulfilling dead-end job writing jingles when he boards a plane to attend his daughter's wedding in London. He hasn't turned out a memorable tune in some time and should Harvey fail to come up with something catchy during his trip overseas he knows that his boss (Richard Schiff) is ready and willing to let him go. Upon arriving in London Harvey is devastated to learn that his daughter (Liane Balaban) has opted to have her stepfather (James Brolin) walk her down the aisle instead of him. And things are about to get worse too. Harvey realizes that he won't be able to suppress his sadness through the whole reception and makes a quick getaway in hopes of catching a plane back home. Perhaps if he can attend an important meeting on Monday morning his boss will have some sympathy and grant him a momentary reprieve. No such luck however because when Harvey misses the flight and calls his boss to explain he is fired over the phone. Later at the airport bar Harvey is drowning his sorrows when he strikes up a conversation with no-nonsense Office of National Statistics employee Kate (Thompson). Kate doesn't have much of a social life; most of her time outside of work is spent suffocating under the love of her smothering mother (Eileen Atkins). She's just gotten through a humiliating string of blind dates and something about Harvey's situation and demeanor strikes a sympathetic chord in the lonely civil servant. Likewise Kate's intelligence and compassion prove unexpectedly invigorating to Harvey. Both Harvey and Kate had always assumed that love had passed them by -- could this middle-aged romance be the glimmer of a new beginning?, Dustin Hoffman | Emma Thompson | Kathy Baker | James Brolin | Eileen Atkins | Liane Balaban | Richard Schiff | Bronagh Gallagher | Jeremy Sheffield | Daniel Lapaine | Patrick Baladi | Michael Landes | Jamie Sives | Kate Harper | Alex Avery | Tim Ahern | Charlotte Lucas, Nights in Rodanthe | Don't Move | Shopgirl | Jump Tomorrow | Random Hearts | The Notebook

Shortly after Charles Taylor was elected as president of Liberia in 1996 he proved to be a hopelessly corrupt dictator. Opposing warlords from the north were terrorizing raping and murdering Liberians by the hundreds of thousands sparking a bloody civil war and many speculated that Taylor was quietly supporting them from the sidelines. Gbowee had already lived through one civil war and the prospect of another was simply too much to bear. Determined to bring peace to her troubled country Gbowee called on everyday Liberian women from neighboring churches to form the Christian Women's Peace Initiative -- a group dedicated to protesting the war that had claimed 250000 lives and displaced over a million citizens. The women of the Christian Women's Peace Initiative dressed in white and came out to protest the war by the thousands even going so far as to surround the building in Ghana where the peace talks were taking place and physically prevent the men from leaving until a deal had been bartered. In addition to proving that peaceful protest could indeed affect change in times of unparalleled strife the Christian Women's Peace Initiative also helped pave the way for Johnson-Sirleaf to be elected as Liberia's first-ever female president., , Citizen Jane: Battle for the City | The Fog of War | Little Dieter Needs to Fly | Maria's Story | Inside Hana's Suitcase | The Agronomist

Born and raised in the Bronx the Kuchar Bbrothers grew up on a cinematic diet of Hollywood kitsch and all manner of big-screen potboilers informed their homemade 8 mm epics such as I Was a Teenage Rumpot and Hold Me While I'm Naked which reflected late-show clichés in a funhouse mirror while injecting them with a comic energy infused with compassion and humanity. The films of the Kuchar Brothers influenced a large and surprisingly diverse range of filmmakers from John Waters and Guy Maddin to Wayne Wang and Atom Egoyan; and George and Mike are not only still making films they've enjoyed long and rich careers as educators teaching what they've learned about filmmaking to several generations of eager students. It Came From Kuchar is a documentary directed by one such former student Jennifer M. Kroot and includes plentiful clips from the Kuchar Brothers' films along with extensive interviews with the brothers behind-the-scenes footage of them at work and testimonials from friends and fans including Buck Henry Bill Griffith Gerard Malanga V.

However in late 2003 Charlie Silver who had inherited the estate made a decision that took many by surprise -- troubled by the encroaching urban sprawl Silver decided to move the mansion and its outbuildings to a new and more peaceful location. Charlie and wife Dena planned to finance the relocation by selling roughly a third of vacant property to developers but not everyone in his family supported this notion; the land had been owned by Silver's kin since 1740 and some relatives felt Midway should remain on its native soil. Film critic Godfrey Cheshire who is Charlie's cousin decided to make a film about the role of Southern plantations in American history popular culture and society as well as the difficult project of moving the mansion. While documenting the relocation Charlie and Godfrey became aware of a previously unknown chapter in their family's history; their great-great grandfather Charles Lewis Hinton who built Midway fathered a child with an African-American slave living on the property.

Traveling across the entire continental United States Kuenne made it his personal mission to interview everyone who had ever known his best friend so their memories would be captured on camera before they faded. Meanwhile upon learning that Turner had fled to Newfoundland Bagby's devastated parents uprooted their entire lives and relocated to the easternmost providence of Canada in order to fight for the future of their newborn grandson Zachary. During the production however the Canadian government freed Turner on bail as she awaited extradition to the United States.

The tale opens during WWII when Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode) an English military officer is stationed at a country estate that has been converted into a military base. Jarrold uses this time-frame and setting as a framing device and then flashes back in time to Charles' days as a scholar in the 1920s. It becomes clear that he was raised in a middle-class household; though he was fortunate enough to have been accepted into Oxford he doesn't belong to the British upper crust. At Oxford Charles strikes up a friendship with twentysomething Lord Sebastian (Ben Whishaw). Charles is captivated by the splendor of Sebastian's life at his family's Brideshead Castle and he finds himself drawn into a web of decadent comfort. For Sebastian though the familial estate represents a prison from which he longs to escape and in desperation he hits the bottle. Charles develops an infatuation with Sebastian's sister Julia (Hayley Atwell) but also senses that his bond with Sebastian may be something far deeper than simple friendship. Also present at Brideshead is Sebastian and Julia's mother Lady Marchmain (Emma Thompson) an ice water-veined woman still reeling from her abandonment some time prior at the hands of her husband. Though bitter the matriarch perceives Charles as an emotional anchor for the increasingly unstable Sebastian and therefore suggests that Charles join Sebastian and Julia on a trip to see their father (Michael Gambon) and his mistress (Greta Scacchi) in Venice. Unfortunately the romantic bond between Charles and Julia deepens which threatens to destroy Sebastian. This feature constitutes the second major version of Brideshead Revisited to reach viewers; an earlier 11-hour miniseries adaptation ran on television in 1981., Hayley Atwell | Ben Whishaw | Matthew Goode | Emma Thompson | Michael Gambon | Greta Scacchi | Jonathan Cake | Patrick Malahide | Thomas Morrison | David Barrass | Anna Madeley | Sarah Crowden | Peter Barnes | Richard Teverson, Cheerful Weather for the Wedding | The Remains of the Day | The Europeans | The Bostonians | The Rainbow | Another Country

Upon Lama Konchog's death the Dalai Lama instructed his disciple Tenzin Zopa to venture out in search of his reincarnated master. But there is an urgency to Zopa's quest because should he fail to locate the "unmistaken child" within the span of four short years it will be too difficult to remove the boy from his parent's care. As a seven-year-old boy Zopa had willingly entered the service of Lama Konchog faithfully remaining by his chosen master's side for the next 21 years. When Lama Konchog died Zopa was devastated. But while the prospect of finding his reincarnation is indeed a foreboding one the loyal disciple is determined to succeed. With little more than dreams and whispers to guide him Zopa sets out across lands that seemed to have been virtually untouched by civilization for an entire century.

The City of Ember was built over 200 year ago deep below the earth where the destruction of a mass-scale disaster couldn't reach it. Equipped with a massive generator and vast supplies the people of Ember have thrived happily for generations -- but the city wasn't meant to be lived in forever. The generator is breaking down and the supplies are running out but two centuries in isolation have robbed the Emberites of their knowledge -- nobody knows how the electric lights work anymore and nobody understands that there's something beyond the city besides darkness. Nobody that is besides Lina (Saoirse Ronan) and Doon (Harry Treadaway) two teenagers who still have the hope that everyone else has lost to ignorance and apathy -- not to mention a sheet of instructions left by the Builders themselves explaining how to leave the city. But the 200-year-old paper is falling apart and pieces are missing. So with the lights threatening to flicker out for the last time and leave Ember in darkness forever Lina and Doon set out on an adventure through the streets sewers and dark caverns of Ember to put the pieces back together. To solve the mystery they'll have to get inside the Builders' heads and avoid the grasp of corrupt Mayor Cole (Bill Murray) who wants to keep Ember the way it is -- no matter what the cost., Saoirse Ronan | Harry Treadaway | Bill Murray | Martin Landau | Mary Kay Place | Toby Jones | Marianne Jean-Baptiste | Mackenzie Crook | Tim Robbins | Catherine Quinn | David Ryall | Ian McElhinney | B.J.

Helmed by director Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi it witnesses the evolution and production of N'Dour's June 2004 album Egypt on the Nonesuch label -- the recording that details N'Dour fully expressing his newfound Muslim faith. A veritable bedrock of controversy the album courted objections from multiple countries: Americans objected because of their post-9/11 tendencies to attribute Islam to violent extremism; Senegalese DJs and radio-station proprietors objected given the odd discomfiture associated with playing religious music about Allah alongside often-racy selections by other acts. Even more significantly N'Dour inadvertently carried this controversy a step further by performing live during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan -- thus infuriating Senegalese religious conservatives. The film witnesses N'Dour confronting these challenges head-on and incredibly surmounting them with great ease and finesse., Youssou N'Dour | Peter Gabriel, Youssou N'Dour: The World of Youssou N'Dour | Tupac: Resurrection | Don't Look Back | Favela Rising | Anita O'Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer | The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll

Flash-forward to 1961 when Stein is a patient at an Israeli mental hospital for Holocaust survivors. Seemingly able to read minds Stein confounds head doctor Nathan Gross (Jacobi) with the question "Who brought a dog in here?" Despite Gross' vehement denial that any such animal is on the premises Stein soon tracks the scent to a young boy who has spent his entire youth locked in a basement and chained to a wall.

Madagascar may be a nice place to visit but for the gang of animals who spent most of their lives in New York there is truly no place like home. After discovering the remnants of a crashed airplane the penguins quickly set about making the repairs needed to get the craft airborne again. When the plane finally takes to the sky it begins to look like it's only a matter of time before Alex the Lion (voice of Ben Stiller) and friends are soaring over New York Harbor. Unfortunately the penguins weren't the aviation experts they claimed to be and before long the crew is coming in for a crash-landing in the untamed plains of Africa. Now as the animals reared in the safety of the zoo come into contact with their decidedly wild counterparts for the very first time they get a better feel for their roots while marveling over the differences between life in the concrete jungle and life on the world's second largest continent. Of course while there's plenty to love about wandering the open plains romantic rivalries and the risk of running into dangerous poachers soon begin to outweigh the joys of some long-overdue family reunions.

The story takes place in 1986 just as Khomeini is coming into power in Iran. Undercover French journalist Freidoune Sahebjam (Jim Caviezel) is traveling though a small southwestern village when his car breaks down. Surrounded by strife but left with little choice other to wait until his car is repaired the anxious Freidoune is soon approached by persistent local Zahra (Shohreh Aghdashloo) who convinces him to follow her into the courtyard behind her home. There she reveals to him that she has just borne witness to a most heinous crime. Just the previous day Zahra had watched the men or her town stone an innocent woman to death. That woman was Soraya (Mozhan Marnò) long-suffering wife of abusive tyrant Ali. Soraya wed Ali in an arranged marriage never realizing the horrors that she and her children would endure under her husband's heavy hand. When Ali requested a divorce so that he would be free to marry a 14-year-old girl Soraya boldly refused knowing that she and the children would most certainly starve to death without a husband to support them. Ali was too poor to return Soraya's dowry as custom dictates in a divorce but he found another way out of the marriage. Under Shariah law adultery is a crime punishable by death if the accused is unable to prove her innocence. Scheming with the newly installed counterfeit mullah Ali accused his wife of adultery. In order to ensure that she had no chance of defending herself he blackmailed several male villagers to testify on his behalf. A tribunal was quickly called and Soraya's fate forever sealed., Shohreh Aghdashloo | Mozhan Marnò | James Caviezel | Bita Sheibani | Ali Pourtash | Parviz Sayyad | David Diaan | Noor Al Taher | Haya Al Taher | Khalid Khan | Vida Ghahremani | Farzaneh Yazdani | Salti Hasan | Laila Qutub | Mizyed Azrai | Talal Nabil Morcos | Abdullah Shaheen | Vachik Mangassarian | Shukreyeh Thijeel | Fadela Rashem | Sabiha Faleh | Zoro Shaswar | Jalal Zadhaley | Arash Kaftoesian | Yousef Shwieyhat | Rami Hamati | Fadi Hamati, The Grapes of Wrath | I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang | The Lost Weekend | Half Nelson | Matewan | Frontera

Activist filmmaker Philippe Diaz examines the history and impact of economic inequality in the third world in the documentary The End of Poverty? and makes the compelling argument that it's not an accident or simple bad luck that has created a growing underclass around the world. Diaz traces the growth of global poverty back to colonization in the 15th century and features interviews with a number of economists sociologists and historians who explain how poverty is the clear consequence of free-market economic policies that allow powerful nations to exploit poorer countries for their assets and keep money in the hands of the wealthy rather than distributing it more equitably to the people who have helped them gain their fortunes. Diaz also explores how wealthy nations (especially the United States) seize a disproportionate share of the world's natural resources and how this imbalance is having a dire impact on the environment as well as the economy.

Moretti stars as Pietro a film executive whose life takes an irreversible and devastating turn one fateful morning. During a trip to the beach with his brother Pietro's path intersects with that of a woman Eleonora (Isabella Ferrari) who is drowning in the ocean; horrified Pietro rushes in to save her. He subsequently returns home only to discover that his wife Lara just died in a nasty falling accident; devastated to the core this nascent widower must make the necessary psychological accommodations to adjust to life as a single parent with sole responsibility for raising his ten-year-old daughter Claudia (Blu Yoshimi). Almost instinctively as a reaction to Lara's death Pietro opts to sit and wait for his daughter to finish school each day (in a park across from the school) in lieu of abandoning her to his own priorities and commitments. This means that the fellow's colleagues in the film industry must by necessity come to do business with him in the park. Through it all Pietro remains silently dumbfounded that the tragedy itself hasn't shaken him more that the grief (the "quiet chaos" of the title) is subtly agonizing instead of grossly traumatizing and debilitating. Nevertheless he ultimately begins to approach a full realization and acceptance of his loss and gains an enhanced awareness of himself and others from the potentially crippling events thrust into his path.

Spector's trademark "wall of sound" -- a technique developed with audio engineers including Larry Levine and others -- emerged in the early '60s; it involved layering various sounds in the recording studio (and doing the actual recording in an echo chamber) to heighten the density and reverberation of the resultant tracks. The effect not only shaped the sound of major acts including the Beatles the Supremes the Beach Boys and the Righteous Brothers but set a unique precedent for many successive performers who later sought to create works of art within a studio setting. In the process Spector grew incredibly wealthy and well-connected but also remained notoriously reclusive and eccentric engendering a tremendous amount of media speculation about his private life. In 2003 a scandal emerged when Lana Clarkson a 41-year-old character actress-cum-fashion model turned up dead at Spector's home -- resulting in one of the most publicized criminal cases of the early 21st century. As directed for the BBC by Vikram Jayanti the unique biographical documentary The Agony and the Ecstasy of Phil Spector probes both the professional triumphs and the criminal fallout of Spector's life. Jayanti uses as the body of the film a number of candid interviews with Spector shot between his first and second murder trials wherein he reflects on his collaborations with giants including Brian Wilson and John Lennon; later in the film the director layers Spector tunes over silent footage of the trial (including grisly crime-scene images) to deliberately jarring effect. This film was originally produced for the BBC and aired in 2008 but updated with additional material in 2009 after the California court system handed out Spector's prison sentence. He received a guilty verdict and got 19 years to life behind bars., Phil Spector, The Devil and Daniel Johnston | You're Gonna Miss Me | Scott Walker: 30 Century Man | Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times | The Beach Boys and the Satan | Let It Be

The events in question began circa 1999 with several lifetime convicts incarcerated in Alabama's Donaldson Correctional Facility who commenced regular Buddhist meditation sessions in that institution. Deeply intrigued by this unusual sociological development Phillips traveled to the penitentiary in the fall of 1999 to interview the men and -- incredibly -- found that the meditation sessions prompted the group to look inward facing their demons and the direct causes of their criminal activity; the sessions thus inaugurated an authentic deep-seated healing process in each individual. Phillips interviewed the men one by one -- sessions that brought her face to face with their surprising openness and desire for permanent psychological and social change; the meetings raised serious penetrating questions in Phillips' mind about the possibility of living a life of inner peace and harmony within the dank rot of the prison environment and -- more significantly -- the possibility of permanent freedom from rage violence and the continued criminal activity to which those phenomena can lead. Deeply inspired she returned to Massachusetts contacted the Vipassana Meditation Center in Shelburne Falls and -- following a year of discussion between that facility and Donaldson -- prompted a 10-day meditation retreat for 36 of the penitentiary inmates. The Stein/Kukura/Phillips film juxtaposes footage from news accounts relaying the convicts' original crimes alongside candid pre-retreat interviews in which the men look ahead and pontificate on the process and results of deep introspection expressing their most deep-seated hopes fears and concerns. It also depicts the incredible process whereby the prison gymnasium was transformed into a Buddhist monastery observes the day-to-day experiences of the retreat itself and follows everything up with interview footage and correspondence demonstratives of the fundamental spiritual and moral changes that took place within the former criminals. In so doing it sheds light on a group of societal outcasts who learned to achieve personal freedom and harmony even as their geographic and social liberties are severely restricted., , Shakespeare Behind Bars | The Farm: Life Inside Angola Prison | After Innocence | Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train | What Remains of Us | Legacy

Dodge Connelly (Clooney) is a brash and handsome gridiron giant who is equally comfortable leading his team in a barroom brawl or charging for a touchdown in a packed stadium. But when Connelly's team loses their sponsor and the entire league appears set to collapse the quick-thinking jock attempts a creative late-game comeback. If Connelly can convince former college football star and decorated war hero Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to join the team there may be hope for the ill-fated team after all. Back in World War I Rutherford single-handedly forced the surrender of multiple German soldiers -- a feat that firmly established the dashing young soldier as America's favorite son. Not only that but Rutherford's unparalleled speed makes him a valuable asset to the team. To cub reporter Lexie Littleton (Renée Zellweger) Rutherford seems simply too good to be true and she's determined to prove that her theory is correct. As Littleton digs deep into Rutherford's past the two teammates enter into a fierce competition for her erratic affections. Now as Connelly's plan begins to work better than he ever could have anticipated the rowdy sport he always loved starts to take on a whole new look and feel. In the midst of holding his team together and simultaneously charming the girl of his dreams Connelly discovers he may be able to use the same strategies he does to win on the field to win in love. Of course there might be a few fouls as this game enters the fourth quarter but like every good player Connelly knows the value of always having a secret play to fall back on before the final score is called., George Clooney | Renée Zellweger | John Krasinski | Jonathan Pryce | Peter Gerety | Jack Thompson | Stephen Root | Wayne Duvall | Keith Loneker | Robert Baker | Matt Bushell | Tommy Hinkley | Nick Paonessa | Max Casella | Mike O'Malley | Heather Goldenhersh | Marian Seldes, Down With Love | Someone Like You | Jerry Maguire | Up in the Air | He Said She Said | Bull Durham

The Nirvana cult has committed an unspeakable act and now that the group has been disbanded its child members are being taken in by welfare services. Twelve-year-old Koichi (Hoshi Ishida) is just such a child. His father was a member of the Nirvana cult and now Koichi has no one to turn to. Enraged and confused at being made a faceless ward of the state Koichi flees from welfare services in an attempt to track down his sister who has recently moved to Tokyo with their grandfather. Along the way Koichi crosses paths with pretty runaway Yuki (Mitsuki Tanimura) who survives on the streets by selling her body. Though the two children are initially able to connect over the fact that they have both lost one parent and suffered terrible mistreatment at the hands of the other Yuki's position in life gives her a kind of tentative erotic power while Koichi's mind remains irreparably damaged due to the months of physical and mental intimidation he was forced to endure while living with the Nirvana cult.

Ben (De Niro) is an aging producer whose career was already on a downward turn when his personal life went straight into the toilet. Not only is Ben juggling two ex-wives and a daughter who seems to have grown up overnight but his colleagues seem to take pleasure in watching him suffer while he attempts to complete his latest film on an impossible schedule. "Fiercely" was supposed to be the visionary movie that revived Ben's career but drug-addicted director Jeremy (Michael Wincott) has clashed with uncompromising studio chief Lou (Catherine Keener) following a disastrous test screening and now it appears as if not even Sean Penn's presence in the film will be enough to make it a box-office hit. Meanwhile Ben's ex-wife Kelly (Robin Wright Penn) can't seem to decide if she loves him or hates him and his teenage daughter Zoe (Kristen Stewart) has gone from playing with Barbie dolls to flirting with boys in the blink of a heavily mascaraed eye. As if that wasn't enough for one man to take in screenwriter Scott (Stanley Tucci) is trying to broker a deal with Ben while simultaneously making a play for his former wife and nebbish agent Dick (John Turturro) is so terrified of his own clients that he can't even ask Bruce Willis to shave his scraggly new beard for an upcoming role. It's all just another day in the world of runaway egos treachery betrayal and deceit that is Hollywood and if Ben can just make it to Cannes with a finished film under his arm and his sanity in tact everything might just work out after all., Robert De Niro | Catherine Keener | Sean Penn | John Turturro | Stanley Tucci | Kristen Stewart | Michael Wincott | Bruce Willis | Jason Kravitz | Mark Ivanir | Remy K.

Heikin, Visit Films, Lorber Films, Food for Thought, Crimes Against Humanity | Totalitarian States, dictator North Korea, , How can a nation of nearly 24 million people hold up one of the world's most infamous despots as a hero? In most of the world Kim Jong-Il president of North Korea is either feared or despised; he's displayed an open willingness to use nuclear weapons on his enemies free speech and other basic human rights are all but unknown under his rule and while a tiny handful of people enjoy wealth in North Korea a famine claimed the lives of over three million in the nation in the 1990s with little improvement since. But at home Kim Jong-Il is all but worshiped by the vast majority of his subjects who celebrate him in song and legend and one admirer has even bred a special begonia in his honor which is named "Kimjongilia" and said to celebrate "wisdom justice love and peace." Dancer-turned-filmmaker N.C. Heikin examines both sides of Kim Jong-Il's public persona in the documentary Kimjongilia which compares and contrasts interviews with North Koreans who speak with awe and admiration of their president (alongside unintentionally comic state-produced propaganda films) with shocking testimony from South Korean exiles who suffered at the hands of Kim's police and spent years in his prisons.

Its violence-scarred and blood-strewn ghettos (or "favelas") are regularly patrolled by crazed drug gangs whose open-fire battles with police often spread out onto the main thoroughfares and turn ordinary civilians into casualties. In response the Brazilian government formed a crack paramilitary force known as the BOPE (Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais or Special Police Operations Battalion) to take matters into its own hands. Now director José Padilha's social-consciousness drama Tropa de Elite carries viewers inside of BOPE for a scathing indictment of the cycle of violence that permeates Brazilian society scripted by 12-year-plus BOPE veteran Rodrigo Pimentel. Wagner Moura (Hector Babenco's Carandiru) stars as Captain Nascimento the leader of a BOPE unit who is seriously considering retirement in the face of his impending fatherhood. In an effort to pick his successor he looks to two younger recruits part-time law student André Matias (André Ramiro) and the bellicose hood Neto (Caio Junqueira) -- but soon recognizes that these naïve men will need to seriously mature before one can take the reins. Inevitably the events that each encounters on the roughshod Brazilian streets -- particularly a trip to clean up some of the neighborhoods in anticipation of the pope's visit -- begin to shape and redefine them in ways that neither can even begin to anticipate. Meanwhile BOPE grapples with its own internal problems -- particularly the extreme corruption and underhandedness of each squad leader whose sideline activities range from resupplying weapons to gangs to the racketeering of strip clubs., Wagner Moura | André Ramiro | Caio Junqueira | Milhem Cortaz | Fernanda Machado | Maria Ribeiro | Thogun, La soga | City of Men | Dog Eat Dog | Elite Squad: The Enemy Within | Sicario | All the King's Men

Planning to spend a few weeks in Northern California with his girlfriend Marcy (Lacey Chabert) Sherman instead discovers that she's dumped him for another more fun-loving guy; adding insult to injury Sherman's wallet and credit cards have been stolen and Evelyn decides it's time to cut off his allowance. With few options and eager to prove he can be free-spirited and self-reliant Sherman decides to hitchhike to Los Angeles for an internship interview and takes a ride with the first person willing to take him down the coast. Sherman's ride turns out to be Palmer (James LeGros) a former Olympic skiing champion-turned-footloose middle-aged bohemian who is more interested in keeping his vintage convertible in tune than in getting anywhere at any specific time.

Peter (Jason Ritter) and Vandy (Jess Weixler) meet when both are college students; they fall in love and live together for a while but on a certain fundamental level they're never fully comfortable with one another and eventually they go their separate ways. But rather than tell their story from beginning to end Peter and Vandy jumps back and forth in time with the couple midway through their romance before we've seen their first date. DiPietro allows us to see how the flaws in their relationship -- Peter's discomfort around Vandy and their habit of bickering about petty things -- were present at the beginning lurking around the corner even in their happiest moments. Peter and Vandy received its world premiere at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival., Jason Ritter | Jess Weixler | Jesse L.

These days the Mayflower is a scorched reminder of human misery the ornate mirrors therein reflecting a suffering so profound that it begins to wear on Ben's already-fragile psyche. Not only that but whatever force dwells behind the shimmering glass seems to have gained the power to alter reality as well. After Ben gazes into the mirrors and sees a vision of himself being relentlessly tortured he is horrified to experience violent convulsions spontaneous bleeding and frightening asphyxiation. And while his sister is always willing to lend a sympathetic ear she chalks the anomalies up to an unusually potent mix of stress and anxiety.

When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination however the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet., Mark Wahlberg | Zooey Deschanel | John Leguizamo | Betty Buckley | Spencer Breslin | Robert Bailey Jr. | Frank Collison | Jeremy Strong | Alan Ruck | Victoria Clark | Alison Folland | M.

Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheelman wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression instinct and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer. Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father Pops Racer (John Goodman) who designed the unbeatable Mach 5 and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton's (Roger Allam) astronomical offer Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother's life so many years ago. In order to accomplish that formidable feat however Speed Racer will not only have to rely on his family and the aid of his longtime girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) but form a tenuous alliance with his longtime rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- as well., Emile Hirsch | Christina Ricci | Susan Sarandon | John Goodman | Matthew Fox | Nicholas Elia | Roger Allam | Melissa Holroyd | Paulie Litt | Ariel Winter | Benno Fürmann | Hiroyuki Sanada | Gian Ganziano | Rain | Peter Fernandez | Richard Roundtree | Harvey Friedman | Kick Gurry | John Benfield | Sadao Ueda | Christian Oliver | Nayo Wallace | Valery Tscheplanowa | Moritz Bleibtreu | Sami Loris | Olivier Marlo | Ashley Walters | Sean McDonagh | Scott Porter | Vinzenz Kiefer | Mark Zak | Willy | Julia Joyce | Clayton Nemrow | Ricky Watson | Brandon Robinson | L.

While she was born and raised in New York Soraya (Suheir Hammad) is of Palestinian heritage and has long dreamed of returning to the land of her ancestors. When Soraya learns that her grandfather bequeathed her a bit more than 15000 dollars that he left in a bank account in Ramallah she decides it's time to make a pilgrimage especially since the inheritance can pay for a long stay in the country. However Soraya arrives in Israel to find that immigration personnel and border guards are not helpful to tourists of Palestinian blood and it takes no small amount of determination before she arrives in Ramallah. There Soraya meets Emad (Saleh Bakri) a handsome Palestinian student who has a scholarship waiting for him at a university in Canada but Israeli immigration authorities refuse to grant him a visa. Soraya and Emad bond over their frustrations at the injustice they see around them and when she learns that the money in her grandfather's account (and all other Palestinian accounts at the bank) was forfeited after the establishment of the nation of Israel they decide to take action.

The saga begins with Gondry's segment entitled "Interior Design" about a young couple who moves in with an old friend while attempting to establish themselves in Tokyo. Hiroko (Ayako Fujitani) and Akira (Ryo Kase) have just arrived in the city. They're eager to launch their careers but first they'll have to find a place to stay. Though Hiroko's old friend Akemi (Ayumi Ito) opens her doors to the ambitious young couple her boyfriend isn't exactly thrilled by the new living arrangement. As Akira takes his first steps toward becoming a filmmaker the neon jungle beckons to Hiroko. Before long Hiroko begins to experience a startling metamorphosis that instills her with a newfound sense of peace and purpose. The second chapter Leos Carax's "Merde" follows the debased exploits of an unsightly subterranean creature (Denis Lavant) who emerges from the Tokyo sewers to taunt and torment the unsuspecting denizens of the city. Stealing cash pilfering cigarettes frightening old ladies and even going so far as to salaciously lick schoolgirls the gibberish-spewing troublemaker dubbed Merde sparks a media frenzy that sends all of Tokyo into a panic. The situation spirals as Merde discovers an arsenal of hand grenades in his underground lair and begins throwing them in the streets at will creating an environment of total urban terror. Later Merde is apprehended and pompous French magistrate Maître Voland (Jean-François Balmer) arrives to defend the deviant in a Japanese court. The only person capable of speaking his client's unintelligible language Voland stands at the center of a media circus that soon engulfs all of Japan. When Merde is convicted by the court and sentenced to death justice takes a turn for the surreal. The trilogy winds to a close with Bong Joon-ho's "Shaking Tokyo" in which a reclusive pizza addict who hasn't left his apartment in over a decade falls for a pretty delivery girl at the very same moment an earthquake hits Japan. A so-called hikikomori who never dares venture outside the lonely shut-in (Teruyuki Kagawa) subsists almost solely on pizza delivery. When a beautiful delivery girl shows up at his door and promptly faints when the ground begins to shake it's love at first sight. Later the agoraphobic man discovers that the object of his affections has become a hikikomori herself and boldly ventures out of his apartment in order to declare his love. The moment he sets eyes on her the ground starts to rumble once again., Ayako Fujitani | Ryo Kase | Ayumi Ito | Denis Lavant | Jean-François Balmer | Renji Ishibashi | Teruyuki Kagawa | Yu Aoi | Naoto Takenaka, Mood Indigo | Paris vu Par... | Paris Vu Par... 20 Ans Apres | New York Stories | Montréal Vu Par... | Bonnie and Clyde

Unfairly and unceremoniously dismissed from her latest position without so much as a penny of severance pay Miss Guinevere Pettigrew (McDormand) realizes that in order to stay financially afloat she'll need to find a new job fast. Though she has worn out her welcome at the unemployment office due to her propensity to lose jobs she's determined to seize the day and keep an open mind. Before she's booted from the office she takes note of a job opening that is a little outside of her experience but decides to pursue it pretending she is the prospective employee the office was planning to recommend.

Upon arriving at the penthouse of up-and-coming American entertainer Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams) the unassuming Miss Pettigrew becomes instantly swept up in the high-society milieu.

Anson was covering the "teen beat" for ABC news when in August of 1965 she sat down for a brief interview The Beatles. At one point in the interview Anson asked McCartney whether he had any plans for marriage. Much to her surprise the teen idol responded by stating "No unless you'll marry me now." At the time Anson simply laughed the proposal off; decades later she's determined to bring "closure" to the situation by tracking McCartney down and asking whether he was serious. Mark Cushman is a filmmaker in search of his breakthrough project and he believes that by turning Anson's adventure into a documentary he'll quickly move on to bigger and better things. Over the course of the production however Cushman quickly begins to realize that his "serious documentary" simply won't be that marketable. The Solution: take a tip from reality television and use a bit of creative editing in order to manipulate the project into something slightly more entertaining. Unfortunately for Anson that means creating a film that could do serious harm to her stand-up reputation., Joe A.
