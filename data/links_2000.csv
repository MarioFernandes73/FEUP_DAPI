Set in a Shanghaiese enclave in Hong Kong in 1962 the film centers on two young couples who rent adjacent rooms in a cramped and crowded tenement. Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) works as a secretary in an export company while her husband's job at a Japanese multinational keeps him away on extended business trips. Across the hall Chow (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) works as a newspaper editor and is married to a woman who is also frequently out of town. Neither respective spouse is ever shown in full instead they are shot from the back or obscured by walls and furniture. Li-zhen and Chow soon strike up a cordial -- if tenative -- friendship. Chow begins to suspect that his wife's long absences are not entirely business related when he stops in unannounced at her office to discover that she is not there. Later a colleague tells him that he saw his wife with another man. The icing on the cake comes when Chow notices that Li-zhen's handbag is identical to his wife's while Li-zhen discovers that Chow is wearing a tie that she gave her husband; it doesn't take long for them to realize that their spouses are sleeping together. Drawn together by shame and anger Chow and Li-zhen reveal nothing of their discoveries to their partners. While working through their guilt by imagining how their adulterous spouses first hooked up and rehearsing interrogations the pair slowly fall in love in spite of their determination to uphold their end of their marital vows. In the Mood for Love which was screened in competition at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival barely made it to the fest's final slot; Wong Kar-wai was reportedly shooting scenes in Cambodia a week prior to the festival., , L'eclisse | 2046 | Far From Heaven | Zhou Yu's Train | Girlfriend Boyfriend | Somewhere

Set somewhere in rural Washington state Czech immigrant Selma (Bjork) works in a pressing plant struggling to make ends meet for herself and her 10-year-old son Gene (Vladica Kostic). Her best friend is coworker and fellow European Kathy (Catherine Deneuve). While outside work she is maintaining a cautious friendship with local yokel Jeff (Peter Stormare). She also landed a starring role as Maria in an amateur production of The Sound of Music. Selma's life would be one of relative contentment if it were not for the ugly secret she harbors -- she is on the verge of blindness due to a genetic disorder and her young son will suffer the same fate without an operation. Selma has quietly been stashing away money for the surgery and has already amassed $2000. When her savings squirreled away in a can in the kitchen suddenly disappear she confronts her cash-strapped landlord Bill (David Morse). Of course like all musicals the plot periodically takes a backseat to the seven production numbers including a show-stopping sequence in Selma's factory. Shot entirely on digital video the film reportedly used up to 100 cameras for each musical number. Dancer in the Dark received top prizes at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival including Best Actress for Bjork and the coveted Palme d'Or for Best Picture., , Greendale | The Purple Rose of Cairo | Vera Drake | A Woman Is a Woman | All That Jazz | West Side Story

Shot in stark black and white the film opens with the sudden and inexplicably bloody hijacking of a bus in rural Kyushu. The crazed gunman (Riju Go) shoots two passengers in the back as they try to flee. Stepping out of the bus for some fresh air the hijacker drags bus driver Makoto (played by the ubiquitous Koji Yakusho) along for cover. When the driver faints and falls to the ground police snipers shoot the terrorist. In his last dying effort the hijacker stumbles back on board the bus where he murders an old lady and tries to kill a pair of shocked schoolchildren Naoki (Masaru Miyazaki) and Kozue (Aoi Miyazaki). Two years later the experience has wreaked havoc on the lives of the three sole survivors. Distanced and easily distracted Makoto's weird behavior -- particularly his habit of wandering off unannounced for days at a time -- finally takes its toll on his marriage. Meanwhile Naoki and Kozue are left mute from the event though they can communicate. The silent siblings' mother soon walks out of her marriage and their father kills himself in a car wreck leaving them alone in a large house with a substantial insurance check. Having found work at a construction company Makoto's strange behavior starts to raise a few eyebrows especially when he utterly ignores the advances of a comely office worker. Soon the village is rocked by news of murdered women washing up on a nearby river bank; Makoto's brother suspects him and asks him to leave their family house. He shows up on the doorstep of Naoki and Kozue's house which has devolved into utter disrepair and the trio forms a family of sorts. Their relative peace and order is upset by Akihiko (Yohichiroh Saitoh) the bumptious cousin from Tokyo on vacation from college who is insensitive to the trauma that the trio has endured and increasingly suspicious of the kids' ersatz guardian. His disapproval of Makoto grows when that same comely office work turns up dead and Makoto is the prime suspect. Looking to break out of their routine and cleared of murder charges Makoto purchases an old bus and converts it into a camper. Taking his three housemates on an odyssey that begins at the site of the hijacking they slowly start to reconcile the grief and pain that so destroyed their lives. Unfortunately the killing seems to follow them along their way.

The film uses the framing device of a present-day narrator who accompanied by a drummer sings the story of Chunhyang in front of a responsive audience. The film flashes back and forth between the singer's presentation and scenes of Mongryong (Cho Seung Woo) a young nobleman who falls captive to the beauty of the commoner Chunhyang (Yi Hyo Jeong). They profess their undying love to each other and elope soon after which Mongryong is forced to accompany his father to Seoul for three years. In the interim a tyrant named Byun (Lee Jung Hun) comes to power in Chunhyang's province and demands that the beauty marry him. She refuses and Byun schedules her for execution -- just as Mongryong returns to the province to reclaim his true love.

The film opens with a group of Kurdish teachers lugging blackboards on their backs in the rocky hinterland looking for illiterates to educate. The group splits up in a panic when they are suddenly confronted by a helicopter border patrol. Two pedagogues Reeboir (Bahman Ghobadi) and Said (Said Mohamadi) camouflage their chalkboards with mud and take separate paths. Reeboir runs into a bevy of semi-feral adolescent boys who look haggard beyond their years; they spent their entire lives hauling (smuggled) goods through harrowing mountain passes. Reeboir tries to convince the lads that they should learn to read but he is firmly rebuffed. Meanwhile Said stumbles upon a wizened old man with a urinary problem and an attractive widowed daughter. Said eventually marries the woman using his blackboard as dowry. Makmalbaf manages to imbue the film with a mood of fear and loss making the characters' indomitable spirit all the more moving.

This documentary serves as both a chronicle of his colorful life and an attempt by his daughter director Aiyanna Elliott to reconnect with her often-absent father. Born Elliott Adnopoz in Brooklyn Jack ran off as a teenager in 1947 to join a traveling rodeo troupe after seeing them perform in Madison Square Garden. He returned to New York and took up singing first cowboy songs then traditional and contemporary folk music. He and Woody Guthrie traveled through the South in the 1950s learning songs from blues artists such as the Reverend Gary Davis Elizabeth Cotton and Jesse Fuller. Elliott remained one of Guthrie's truest friends all through Guthrie's long battle with Huntington's chorea the congenital nerve disease that killed him in 1967. In 1955 Elliott and the first of his four wives decamped to England where his reputation was made with fans of the skiffle music craze. He returned to New York in 1961 just as the folk music boom was producing its biggest hero Bob Dylan who aped both Guthrie and Elliott in his early recordings. Among the interviewees are Nora and Arlo Guthrie singers Pete Seeger and Dave Van Ronk and ex-wives and managers who all agree on Elliott's carefree attitude toward schedules and money. His almost pathological determination not to conform to any kind of bourgeois lifestyle eventually crippled his chances for wider recognition though in the mid-'90s he won a Grammy and a National Medal of the Arts awarded by President Bill Clinton. The vintage clips are interspersed with Aiyanna Elliott trailing her father around with a camera and microphone hoping to capture some admission of past mistakes but as always Ramblin' Jack Elliott is a tough man to pin down., , A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake | The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time! | Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus | Bound for Glory | Johnny Cash: The Man His World His Music | Pete Seeger...

John Brown believed he had a calling to end slavery in this nation. Unlike many such men who sat back and let their words speak Brown put thought into action. Two years before the start of the Civil War John Brown and a handful of followers seized the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry. They intended to arm slaves and lead a nation wide revolt. Instead Marines under the leadership of Robert E. Lee put and end to Brown's dream. The ensuing trial pushed the divisive issue of slavery to the fore of America's consciousness and lit the long fuse that exploded at Fort Sumter. This video examines the life of this willing martyr and tries to explain where he came from and how this country produced a man who in many ways was our first domestic terrorist.

As the black-and-white film opens a wealthy young man Jae-hoon (Jeong Bo-seok) arrives at a hotel room and examines it while he waits for a woman to join him. Soo-jung (Lee Eun-ju of Tae Guk Gi) phones him after a while and tries to get out of their planned tryst. They argue on the phone. The film then flashes back to show us in numbered and sometimes titled episodes how the relationship between these two characters developed. Jae-hoon was working as an assistant to a struggling filmmaker Young-soo (Mun Seong-kun of A Petal). After several social engagements Jae-hoon suggests to Young-soo that he might be interested in financing his next film. Jae-hoon begins to pursue Soo-jung who keeps him at bay for a while. But Jae-hoon is persistent and eventually she relents. She lets him know that she is a virgin. Eventually it becomes clear that Young-soo also has a romantic interest in Soo-jung. Jae-hoon gets jealous and he and Young-soo get into a big argument but they patch things up and make plans to go to an expensive hotel on Cheju Island where presumably they will have sex. At the film's midway point Hong returns us to the first chapter and we are taken through the story again with many changes to the action -- some subtle and some more severe. The film's English-language title is an apparent reference to Marcel Duchamp's artwork "The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors Even." The original Korean title is the far more prosaic Oh!

Childhood best buddies Chuck and Buck are reunited after 18 years during the funeral of the latter's mother. Chuck (Chris Weitz who also produced American Pie (1999)) is a button-down movie executive with a gorgeous blond fiancée Carlyn (Beth Colt). By contrast the intervening years do not seem to have matured Buck (Mike White) in the slightest -- he still plays with children's toys throws bawling temper tantrums and seems to be utterly at a loss at what to do after his mother's death. During the funeral Buck greets his old friend with an oblivious joy that is hardly appropriate to the setting. Clearly expecting that the friendship will continue where it left off back during the Carter administration Buck seems confused and sullen in the presence of Carlyn a yucky girl. This jealousy turns more unnerving when in midst of a brotherly hug Buck makes a clumsy grope for Chuck's manhood. Disturbed and embarrassed Chuck quickly leaves but not before Carlyn politely suggests that Buck "visit us in L.A. sometime." Buck leaps at the chance and soon is packing up for California. He quickly degenerates from a silly though pathetic annoyance to a lollipop-sucking stalker. Buck's bizarre attempts to renew his bond with Chuck and to consummate their relationship puts Chuck increasingly on edge and confronts the affluent yuppie with a past he'd just as soon forget.

Somehow he escapes from his prison but when he relates his experiences to the police they are more inclined to believe that Ballard's story is based on drug-induced hallucinations than fact. Later he discovers his girlfriend strung up with barbed wire and an incriminating message written in her blood.

Twenty-one-year-old suburban kid Ron (Edward Furlong) got busted for dealing drugs and slapped with an especially severe jail sentence. Though he tries to keep a low profile at prison he soon attracts unsavory attention of various sex-starved goons. Fearing rape he appeals directly to Earl (Willem Dafoe) a fellow prisoner who runs the place like it was his own fiefdom. Though Ron's request is strictly against this rarified culture's baroque rules Earl takes him under his wing and soon he is a part of Earl's inner circle. Slowly Ron learns the breadth of Earl's power ranging from the easy procurement of drugs to the violent dispatching of a prisoner who gets out of line. As Ron grows increasingly indebted to Earl he wonders how he is expected to repay him. Yet Earl who shows his fondness for the lad with fatherly tenderness counterbalanced with repressed yearning never pushes his advantage. Other members of the cast include Tom Arnold as a salivating hill-billy and an almost unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as a cross-dressing prison queen.
