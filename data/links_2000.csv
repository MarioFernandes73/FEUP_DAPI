Set in a Shanghaiese enclave in Hong Kong in 1962 the film centers on two young couples who rent adjacent rooms in a cramped and crowded tenement. Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) works as a secretary in an export company while her husband's job at a Japanese multinational keeps him away on extended business trips. Across the hall Chow (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) works as a newspaper editor and is married to a woman who is also frequently out of town. Neither respective spouse is ever shown in full instead they are shot from the back or obscured by walls and furniture. Li-zhen and Chow soon strike up a cordial -- if tenative -- friendship. Chow begins to suspect that his wife's long absences are not entirely business related when he stops in unannounced at her office to discover that she is not there. Later a colleague tells him that he saw his wife with another man. The icing on the cake comes when Chow notices that Li-zhen's handbag is identical to his wife's while Li-zhen discovers that Chow is wearing a tie that she gave her husband; it doesn't take long for them to realize that their spouses are sleeping together. Drawn together by shame and anger Chow and Li-zhen reveal nothing of their discoveries to their partners. While working through their guilt by imagining how their adulterous spouses first hooked up and rehearsing interrogations the pair slowly fall in love in spite of their determination to uphold their end of their marital vows. In the Mood for Love which was screened in competition at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival barely made it to the fest's final slot; Wong Kar-wai was reportedly shooting scenes in Cambodia a week prior to the festival., Maggie Cheung | Rebecca Pan | Siu Ping-Lam, L'eclisse | 2046 | Far From Heaven | Zhou Yu's Train | Girlfriend Boyfriend | Somewhere

Set somewhere in rural Washington state Czech immigrant Selma (Bjork) works in a pressing plant struggling to make ends meet for herself and her 10-year-old son Gene (Vladica Kostic). Her best friend is coworker and fellow European Kathy (Catherine Deneuve). While outside work she is maintaining a cautious friendship with local yokel Jeff (Peter Stormare). She also landed a starring role as Maria in an amateur production of The Sound of Music. Selma's life would be one of relative contentment if it were not for the ugly secret she harbors -- she is on the verge of blindness due to a genetic disorder and her young son will suffer the same fate without an operation. Selma has quietly been stashing away money for the surgery and has already amassed $2000. When her savings squirreled away in a can in the kitchen suddenly disappear she confronts her cash-strapped landlord Bill (David Morse). Of course like all musicals the plot periodically takes a backseat to the seven production numbers including a show-stopping sequence in Selma's factory. Shot entirely on digital video the film reportedly used up to 100 cameras for each musical number.

Shot in stark black and white the film opens with the sudden and inexplicably bloody hijacking of a bus in rural Kyushu. The crazed gunman (Riju Go) shoots two passengers in the back as they try to flee. Stepping out of the bus for some fresh air the hijacker drags bus driver Makoto (played by the ubiquitous Koji Yakusho) along for cover. When the driver faints and falls to the ground police snipers shoot the terrorist. In his last dying effort the hijacker stumbles back on board the bus where he murders an old lady and tries to kill a pair of shocked schoolchildren Naoki (Masaru Miyazaki) and Kozue (Aoi Miyazaki). Two years later the experience has wreaked havoc on the lives of the three sole survivors. Distanced and easily distracted Makoto's weird behavior -- particularly his habit of wandering off unannounced for days at a time -- finally takes its toll on his marriage. Meanwhile Naoki and Kozue are left mute from the event though they can communicate. The silent siblings' mother soon walks out of her marriage and their father kills himself in a car wreck leaving them alone in a large house with a substantial insurance check. Having found work at a construction company Makoto's strange behavior starts to raise a few eyebrows especially when he utterly ignores the advances of a comely office worker. Soon the village is rocked by news of murdered women washing up on a nearby river bank; Makoto's brother suspects him and asks him to leave their family house. He shows up on the doorstep of Naoki and Kozue's house which has devolved into utter disrepair and the trio forms a family of sorts. Their relative peace and order is upset by Akihiko (Yohichiroh Saitoh) the bumptious cousin from Tokyo on vacation from college who is insensitive to the trauma that the trio has endured and increasingly suspicious of the kids' ersatz guardian. His disapproval of Makoto grows when that same comely office work turns up dead and Makoto is the prime suspect. Looking to break out of their routine and cleared of murder charges Makoto purchases an old bus and converts it into a camper.

Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is a tough though painfully honest girl living in Brooklyn. Surly frustrated and directionless Diana seems to have a ticket on the express train to expulsion; she repeatedly finds herself in detention and schoolyard fights. At home her weak though abusive single father Sandro (Paul Calderon) clearly favorites her bookish brother Tiny (Ray Santiago) over her. While running an errand for her father Diana finds herself in one of New York's more renowned boxing gyms and she instantly connects to the same. Though traditionally a thoroughly male pastime in Latino culture Diana perseveres and gains self-worth thanks to the help of gruff Panamanian trainer Hector (Jaime Tirelli). Soon Hector assumes the role of Diana's father from her deadbeat biological progenitor. As Diana gains physical strength and agility in the ring she finds herself drawn to the dashing boxer Adrian (Santiago Douglas) who is supposedly involved with someone else. Slowly though the two give into their mutual attraction and fall completely in love. Fate intervenes when the two lovers are scheduled to fight one another in the ring forcing each to choose boxing or love.

The film opens with a group of Kurdish teachers lugging blackboards on their backs in the rocky hinterland looking for illiterates to educate. The group splits up in a panic when they are suddenly confronted by a helicopter border patrol. Two pedagogues Reeboir (Bahman Ghobadi) and Said (Said Mohamadi) camouflage their chalkboards with mud and take separate paths. Reeboir runs into a bevy of semi-feral adolescent boys who look haggard beyond their years; they spent their entire lives hauling (smuggled) goods through harrowing mountain passes. Reeboir tries to convince the lads that they should learn to read but he is firmly rebuffed. Meanwhile Said stumbles upon a wizened old man with a urinary problem and an attractive widowed daughter. Said eventually marries the woman using his blackboard as dowry. Makmalbaf manages to imbue the film with a mood of fear and loss making the characters' indomitable spirit all the more moving.

This documentary serves as both a chronicle of his colorful life and an attempt by his daughter director Aiyanna Elliott to reconnect with her often-absent father. Born Elliott Adnopoz in Brooklyn Jack ran off as a teenager in 1947 to join a traveling rodeo troupe after seeing them perform in Madison Square Garden. He returned to New York and took up singing first cowboy songs then traditional and contemporary folk music. He and Woody Guthrie traveled through the South in the 1950s learning songs from blues artists such as the Reverend Gary Davis Elizabeth Cotton and Jesse Fuller. Elliott remained one of Guthrie's truest friends all through Guthrie's long battle with Huntington's chorea the congenital nerve disease that killed him in 1967. In 1955 Elliott and the first of his four wives decamped to England where his reputation was made with fans of the skiffle music craze. He returned to New York in 1961 just as the folk music boom was producing its biggest hero Bob Dylan who aped both Guthrie and Elliott in his early recordings. Among the interviewees are Nora and Arlo Guthrie singers Pete Seeger and Dave Van Ronk and ex-wives and managers who all agree on Elliott's carefree attitude toward schedules and money. His almost pathological determination not to conform to any kind of bourgeois lifestyle eventually crippled his chances for wider recognition though in the mid-'90s he won a Grammy and a National Medal of the Arts awarded by President Bill Clinton. The vintage clips are interspersed with Aiyanna Elliott trailing her father around with a camera and microphone hoping to capture some admission of past mistakes but as always Ramblin' Jack Elliott is a tough man to pin down., Kris Kristofferson | Arlo Guthrie | Pete Seeger | Odette | Dave Van Ronk, A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake | The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time! | Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus | Bound for Glory | Johnny Cash: The Man His World His Music | Pete Seeger...

John Brown believed he had a calling to end slavery in this nation. Unlike many such men who sat back and let their words speak Brown put thought into action. Two years before the start of the Civil War John Brown and a handful of followers seized the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry. They intended to arm slaves and lead a nation wide revolt. Instead Marines under the leadership of Robert E. Lee put and end to Brown's dream. The ensuing trial pushed the divisive issue of slavery to the fore of America's consciousness and lit the long fuse that exploded at Fort Sumter. This video examines the life of this willing martyr and tries to explain where he came from and how this country produced a man who in many ways was our first domestic terrorist. Although its length may preclude its use in some contexts this video is certainly appropriate for the college classroom as it presents the events of the day in all their complexity., , Sir!

Set in three chapters spanning from the beginning of the 1900s to after WWI the first section takes place in the fictional village of Barbazac located in the Cognac region. Protestant pastor Jean Barnery (Charles Berling) learns of his wife Nathalie's (Isabelle Huppert) infidelity from the village grapevine and sends his daughter away.

The second chapter opens with Pauline visiting Jean who is bedridden in a Parisian hotel from tuberculosis. Upon his recovery they marry and live for a spell in Switzerland until Jean's family entreat him to return to Limoges and take over the floundering family porcelain business. The final chapter opens with bombs of WWI: Jean is sent to the front while Pauline works as a nurse. When the war finally draws to a close Jean struggles to keep the business afloat. He raises the ire of his workers and stockholders alike by freezing wages and slashing dividends but his fastidious attention to detail soon makes his company the finest producer of porcelain in Europe.

As the black-and-white film opens a wealthy young man Jae-hoon (Jeong Bo-seok) arrives at a hotel room and examines it while he waits for a woman to join him. Soo-jung (Lee Eun-ju of Tae Guk Gi) phones him after a while and tries to get out of their planned tryst. They argue on the phone. The film then flashes back to show us in numbered and sometimes titled episodes how the relationship between these two characters developed. Jae-hoon was working as an assistant to a struggling filmmaker Young-soo (Mun Seong-kun of A Petal). After several social engagements Jae-hoon suggests to Young-soo that he might be interested in financing his next film. Jae-hoon begins to pursue Soo-jung who keeps him at bay for a while. But Jae-hoon is persistent and eventually she relents. She lets him know that she is a virgin. Eventually it becomes clear that Young-soo also has a romantic interest in Soo-jung. Jae-hoon gets jealous and he and Young-soo get into a big argument but they patch things up and make plans to go to an expensive hotel on Cheju Island where presumably they will have sex. At the film's midway point Hong returns us to the first chapter and we are taken through the story again with many changes to the action -- some subtle and some more severe. The film's English-language title is an apparent reference to Marcel Duchamp's artwork "The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors Even." The original Korean title is the far more prosaic Oh!

Chuck (Chris Weitz who also produced American Pie (1999)) is a button-down movie executive with a gorgeous blond fiancée Carlyn (Beth Colt). By contrast the intervening years do not seem to have matured Buck (Mike White) in the slightest -- he still plays with children's toys throws bawling temper tantrums and seems to be utterly at a loss at what to do after his mother's death. During the funeral Buck greets his old friend with an oblivious joy that is hardly appropriate to the setting. Clearly expecting that the friendship will continue where it left off back during the Carter administration Buck seems confused and sullen in the presence of Carlyn a yucky girl. This jealousy turns more unnerving when in midst of a brotherly hug Buck makes a clumsy grope for Chuck's manhood. Disturbed and embarrassed Chuck quickly leaves but not before Carlyn politely suggests that Buck "visit us in L.A. sometime." Buck leaps at the chance and soon is packing up for California. He quickly degenerates from a silly though pathetic annoyance to a lollipop-sucking stalker. Buck's bizarre attempts to renew his bond with Chuck and to consummate their relationship puts Chuck increasingly on edge and confronts the affluent yuppie with a past he'd just as soon forget. Chuck & Buck was one of the most talked about films at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival., Mike White | Chris Weitz | Lupe Ontiveros | Beth Colt | Paul Weitz | Maya Rudolph | Mary Wigmore | Paul Sand, Say Uncle | Fear Anxiety & Depression | Dummy | Storytelling | Happiness | The King of Comedy

Set in the late 1940s in the remote thoroughly backwards village of San Pedro de los Saguaros the film focuses on Vargas (Damian Alcazar) a petty politician who had the dubious honor of being appointed town mayor after his predecessor was decapitated for corruption by an angry mob. At first he tries to balance the books and to bring the 20th century to the backwaters. When he is visited by slick PRI politico Lopez (Pedro Armendariz) however he learns the officially sanctioned way of running the town: at gunpoint while pilfering the bank vaults. Soon Vargas becomes a power-mad despot more than willing to steal or kill to further his goals. Though his PRI bosses try to reign him in the lynch mob soon appears to be the inevitable end of Vargas' political career. The first film to criticize the PRI by name Estrada's bitter farce savages the ruling party the church and U.S. intervention.

Shimizu went on to make an extended version of the movie misleadingly titled Ju-on 2 and a big-budget film based on the original video. Ju-on is a series of vignettes about a curse that passes on from one aggrieved dead person to the next. Kobayashi (Yuurei Yanagi) a young teacher with a pregnant wife goes to visit the home of Toshio (Ryôta Koyama) a boy who's been missing from his class. He finds the house a wreck and the boy alone and seemingly traumatized. The story then makes a temporal leap as we find a teenager Yuki (Hitomi Miwa) at the same house studying with her classmate Kanna (Asumi Miwa) who lives there with her brother Tsuyoshi (Kazushi Andô) and their mother Noriko (Yumi Yoshiyuki). Yuki has some kind of phobia about cats. Kanna remembers that she forgot to feed the rabbits at school and rushes off leaving Yuki. A cat wanders into the room and frightens Yuki into the closet. She hears a rattling noise coming from the crawlspace over the closet and ill-advisedly takes a look up there. Mizuho (Chiaki Kuriyama) Tsuyoshi's girlfriend goes looking for him at the school where she runs into a ghostly Toshio mewling like a cat and meets a gruesome fate. Noriko returns home to an empty house. Kanna soon comes home but she's...changed. The film then cuts back to Kobayashi as he discovers the gruesome fate of Toshio's mother an old schoolmate of his and also finds out about his own surprising link to the strange boy. The story ends with Kyôko (Yûko Daike) a woman with psychic powers who is helping her brother sell the cursed house., , The Grudge | Ringu | Dark Water | Wishing Stairs | Ju-on 2 | Kwaidan

Twenty-one-year-old suburban kid Ron (Edward Furlong) got busted for dealing drugs and slapped with an especially severe jail sentence. Though he tries to keep a low profile at prison he soon attracts unsavory attention of various sex-starved goons. Fearing rape he appeals directly to Earl (Willem Dafoe) a fellow prisoner who runs the place like it was his own fiefdom. Though Ron's request is strictly against this rarified culture's baroque rules Earl takes him under his wing and soon he is a part of Earl's inner circle. Slowly Ron learns the breadth of Earl's power ranging from the easy procurement of drugs to the violent dispatching of a prisoner who gets out of line. As Ron grows increasingly indebted to Earl he wonders how he is expected to repay him. Yet Earl who shows his fondness for the lad with fatherly tenderness counterbalanced with repressed yearning never pushes his advantage. Other members of the cast include Tom Arnold as a salivating hill-billy and an almost unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as a cross-dressing prison queen. This film was highly praised at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival., Willem Dafoe | Edward Furlong | Seymour Cassel | Mickey Rourke | Steve Buscemi | Tom Arnold | John Heard | Danny Trejo | Michael Buscemi | Mark Boone Jr., The Shawshank Redemption | Cool Hand Luke | The Big House | King Rat | Kimusho No Naka | Fortune and Men's Eyes

In 1961 the house is home to Edith (Vanessa Redgrave) and Abby (Marian Seldes) an elderly lesbian couple whose lifestyle is not accepted or acknowledged by their families. When Abby suffers a serious stroke and is on the verge of death her family rallies to her side but not understanding the nature of her relationship with Edith she is not included as her loved ones say their final good-byes. After Abby's death her nephew (Paul Giamatti) and his wife (Elizabeth Perkins) arrive from out of state with plans to sell the house without consulting Edith. In 1972 the house is now home to four college students Michelle (Amy Carlson) Linda (Michelle Williams) Karen (Nia Long) and Jeanne (Natasha Lyonne) all of whom are actively involved in the women's movement and also happen to be lesbians. The four find themselves at odds with the campus women's group when they try to promote an all-women's dance while the other members of the group feel that feminism not lesbianism should be the focus of the group. Similarly Linda faces hostility from her friends when she becomes involved with Amy (Chloe Sevigny) a very butch townie; Linda's friends see Amy's masculine attire and attitude as a form of self-loathing against being a woman and while Linda cares deeply for Amy she's not always comfortable with her and isn't sure that she wants to be public with their relationship. In 2000 Fran (Sharon Stone) and Kal (Ellen DeGeneres) a happy and firmly committed couple are sharing the house and after much discussion they decide that they want to take their relationship to the next level and have a baby. However deciding that they want a child and dealing with the practicalities of getting pregnant are two different things; Fran and Kal first debate about going to a sperm bank as opposed to asking one of their male friends to help out and later either going to a doctor to perform the procedure or trying it at home. DeGeneres' significant other Anne Heche wrote and directed the final segment; the 1972 story was directed by Martha Coolidge and the 1961 episode was directed by Jane Anderson., Vanessa Redgrave | Marian Seldes | Paul Giamatti | Elizabeth Perkins | Jenny O'Hara | Donald Elson | Michelle Williams | Nia Long | Natasha Lyonne | Heather McComb | Amy Carlson | Lee Garlington | Rashida Jones | Kirk Trutner | Sharon Stone | Ellen DeGeneres | Regina King | Kathy Najimy | Mitchell Anderson | George Newbern | Lucinda Jenney, Personal Velocity: Three Portraits | Roe vs. Wade | Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her | If These Walls Could Talk | A Home at the End of the World | Common Ground

Shortly before Mr. Duck kills himself he gives Richard a crude map to a place in Thailand that he claims is paradise on earth: beautiful unspoiled and uninhabited. For lack of anything better to do Richard and his companions try to locate the spot which after a dangerous and taxing journey takes them to a beach as beautiful as Duck said it would be. Richard and his friends settle in but before long they discover that they are not alone; a large group of fellow travelers has already dug themselves in and they have established a community with the same social evils that Richard was hoping to leave behind. Just as important there is an army of natives who grow marijuana in the nearby hills and do not appreciate the presence of these visitors. The Beach proved controversial during production partly due to production delays and shifting release dates partly due to environmental concerns after crew members bulldozed parts of the Thai island of Phi Phi Le for the planting of non-native trees., Leonardo DiCaprio | Tilda Swinton | Virginie Ledoyen | Guillaume Canet | Paterson Joseph | Robert Carlyle | Peter Youngblood Hills | Jerry Swindall | Lars Arentz Hansen | Daniel York | Somboon Phutaroth | Jak Boon | Krongthong Thampradith | Abhijati Jusakul | Somchai Santitarangkul | Zelda Tinska | Victoria Smurfit | Daniel Caltagirone | Peter Gevisser | Lidija Zovkic | Staffan Kihlbom | Jukka Hiltunen | Magnus Lindgren | Myriam Acharki | Andrew Carmichael | Joshua Cole | Hélène de Fougerolles | Bindu de Stoppani | Nina Jacques | Sheriden Jones | Gunilla Karlson | Isabella Seibert | Elizabeth Thomas | Timothy Webster | Saskia Mulder | Simone Huber | Patcharawan Patarakijjanon, Escobar: Paradise Lost | The Emerald Forest | Brokedown Palace | La Vallée | At Play in the Fields of the Lord | The Hustler

He not only appreciates his wife but he also begins to serve liquor.

Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand) is a bright loving but strict single parent whose distrust of rock music and fears about drug use have helped to drive a wedge between herself and her two children Anita (Zooey Deschanel) and William (Patrick Fugit). Anita rebels by dropping out of school and becoming a stewardess but William makes something of his love of rock & roll by writing album reviews for a local underground newspaper. William's work attracts the attention of Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) editor of renegade rock magazine Creem who takes William under his wing and gives him his first professional writing assignment -- covering a Black Sabbath concert. While William is unable to score an interview with the headliners the opening act Stillwater are more than happy to chat with a reporter even if he's still too young to drive and William's piece on the group in Creem gains him a new admirer in Ben Fong-Torres (Terry Chen) an editor at Rolling Stone. Torres offers William an assignment for a 3000-word cover story on Stillwater and over the objections of his mother (whose parting words are "Don't use drugs!") and after some stern advice from Bangs (who says under no circumstances should he become friends with a band he's covering) Williams joins Stillwater on tour where he becomes friendly with guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). William also becomes enamored of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) a groupie traveling with the band who is no older than William but is deeply involved with Russell. Lester Bangs and Ben Fong-Torres incidentally were real-life rock writers Crowe worked with closely during his days as a journalist.

South of the border Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) attempts to wage his own war on drugs heading off a cocaine shipment in the middle of the desert with his less-than-virtuous partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas). Surrounded by corruption Javier approaches the drug war with an attitude of patience and compromise which opens him up to investigation from General Arturo Salazar (Tomas Milian) the country's dubious drug-enforcement liaison to the U.S. Meanwhile San Diego drug kingpin Carlos Alaya (Steven Bauer) is caught in a sting operation spearheaded by DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) leaving behind his very pregnant and very oblivious wife Helena (Catharine Zeta-Jones). At the behest of Carlos' lawyer and shady confidante Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid) Helena decides to carry on the family business -- with tragic consequences.

But Leonard's problems are different from those of most people in his situation; he was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; he is incapable of retaining any new information and must resort to copious note-taking and Polaroid photographs in order to keep track of what happens to him over the course of a day (he's even tattooed himself with a few crucial bits of information he can't get along without). Leonard retains awareness that his wife was brutally murdered however and he's convinced that the culprit still walks the streets. Leonard is obsessed with the notion of taking revenge against the man who has ruined his life and he sets out to find him getting help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who appears to be a sympathetic barmaid and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who claims to be Leonard's friend even though Leonard senses that he cannot be trusted.

Five years old when he and his mother escaped from Cuba to Florida (an ordeal that claimed his mother's life) Elian (Alec Roberts) was installed in the Miami house of his relatives. Though that seemed to be the end of the story Elian's father Juan Gonzalez (Esai Morales) still living in Cuba and still loyal to the Castro regime launched a legal campaign to have his son returned to him. As the whole world knows the Gonzalez matter was settled by the U.S. government with a dramatic denouement in the dead of night as Federal agents broke down the door of his Florida family's home and plucked Elian from his bedroom-closet hiding place. Rather than debate or draw conclusions from the issues raised by this volatile incident Dennis Turner the writer of this made-for-cable docudrama has concocted an evenly balanced teleplay in which true to the complexity of the situation there are no heroes or villains.

In the aftermath of the French Revolution the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) manages to narrowly escape execution during the Reign of Terror and instead is sentenced to the Charenton Asylum for the Insane. Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) the priest who heads the asylum is sympathetic to the political machinations that have put the Marquis in his care and allows him not only to write what he pleases but to stage theater pieces using the other patients as actors. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) a tyrannical doctor overseeing the mental institutions of Napoleonic France is as outraged as the emperor when he reads Justine a scabrous volume the Marquis penned while an inmate at Charenton and he demands that de Sade be stopped. But Royer-Collard soon learns that stopping the Marquis from writing is not so simple; when de Sade's quills and ink are taken from him he uses wine and even his own blood to write his stories. When these options are no longer available he dictates his work with the help of Madeline (Kate Winslet) a laundry girl working at the asylum who is fascinated by the notorious de Sade though she declines his frequent requests to satisfy his notorious sexual appetites. Based on the play by Doug Wright (who also penned the screenplay) Quills was directed by Philip Kaufman who previously documented the line between eroticism and literature in Henry and June and The Unbearable Lightness of Being., Geoffrey Rush | Kate Winslet | Joaquin Phoenix | Michael Caine | Billie Whitelaw | Patrick Malahide | Pauline McLynn | Stephen Moyer, Bel Ami | Amadeus | Dangerous Liaisons | The Pillow Book | Pandaemonium | Orlando

While Hitler did not initially make clear his plans for a genocide of Germany's Jews he openly stated his desire that Germany be free of Jews. Few nations were willing to accept the large numbers of German Jews who now wished to expatriate in fear of their lives. However Great Britain agreed to permit Jewish children between the ages of 5 and 17 to come to the U.K. -- without their parents. Between December of 1938 and August of 1939 some 10000 German children gained refuge in the U.K. Most were adopted by British families and many of the older boys served in the British Army fighting against the Nazis but the majority were never to see their birth parents again. Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport is a documentary that looks at the "Kindertransport" which ferried the children to Great Britain and what became of the children once they arrived in England.

Murnau and his obsession with creating realistic horror by any means necessary -- even if those means include actual bloodletting. The film begins as Murnau (John Malkovich) is ready to take his unauthorized interpretation of the Bram Stoker tale on location in Czechoslovakia. There the director has arranged for his cast and crew to live in the same castle in which they will shoot their parts as they all wait for their co-star Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe) -- Murnau's choice to play Count Orlok -- to arrive. Their leader has warned them that Schreck is a student of the Stanislovsky method of performance and will not respond to them out-of-character. Nothing however can prepare them for the real thing: when the actor arrives he's already in full Gothic regalia asserting that he is indeed a vampire. Schreck makes good on his claims by terrorizing the cast and crew attacking Murnau's original cinematographer (Wolfgang Muller) and plucking bats out of the air for midnight snacks. Director E.

The story opens as Lily (Gillian Anderson) takes tea at the apartment of Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz) a young bachelor lawyer to whom Lily is attracted but cannot marry because he is not wealthy enough for her liking. Lily stops at Selden's apartment en route to Bellomont where she is planning to husband-hunt at the country home of shifty businessman Gus Trenor (Dan Aykroyd) and his wife. Gus agrees to invest some money for Lily but his intentions toward her quickly turn carnal and when she rebuffs his advances she finds herself $9000 in debt. Help arrives in the form of financier Sim Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia) who extends to Lily a businesslike proposition of marriage; though she is tempted Lily refuses his offer because he is nouveau riche rather than blueblood society. Soldiering on Lily journeys to the Mediterranean where she has been invited to the home of Bertha Dorset (Laura Linney) an alpha socialite who schemes to use Lily as an unwitting decoy for an affair under the nose of her husband George (Terry Kinney). When the trip starts to go bad George tells Lily that he wants to divorce the slatternly Bertha but needs some solid proof of her affairs in order to do so. Lily knows that one of Bertha's previous lovers was Selden but her loyalty to him prevents her from speaking up to George. So still in debt to Gus and given only a paltry inheritance by her aunt (Eleanor Bron) Lily endures a slew of unsuccessful jobs and tragically gradually sinks into the mire of genteel poverty.

Jazz roots itself in New Orleans for its first installment Gumbo. One of the 19th century's most progressive cities the "wide open" town was filled with gambling prostitution crime -- and music. Burns shows how African-American musicians combined Caribbean rhythms opera minstrel shows and (most importantly) marching bands with ragtime and the blues to produce a music that would soon be called "jass" and later "jazz." The viewer is introduced to such legendary innovators of the music as Buddy Bolden -- the trumpet player who although never recorded is mythically touted as the first true jazz musician -- and pianist Jelly Roll Morton who flamboyantly claimed to have invented jazz (he was the first to notate the music on paper). It is also made apparent how race played a large factor in the development of the music. In 1917 a group of white musicians calling themselves the Original Dixieland Jazz Band recorded the first jazz record and quickly became a huge success -- at once polarizing black musicians and ringing in the "Jazz Age.", Wynton Marsalis | Keith David | Ken Burns, Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 2: The Gift 1917-1924 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 8: Risk 1945-1946 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 6: Swing - The Velocity of Celebration 1937-1939 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 10: A Masterpiece by Midnight 1961-Present | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 3: Our Language 1924-1928 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 5: Swing - Pure Pleasure 1935-1937

During this time when jazz flourished unparalleled prosperity across the country created an atmosphere ripe for flappers gangsters speakeasies and all-around good times. Burns introduces viewers to the most important figure in jazz Louis Armstrong. After surviving a fatherless childhood in the roughest part of New Orleans Armstrong grew up to become the first true jazz soloist and influence the course of jazz for decades to come.

There is also the tragic story of the first great white jazz musician cornetist Bix Beiderbecke who would create some of the most poignant and melodic solos of his day and then die at age 28 from complications arising from his alcoholism. Burns touches on the Harlem Renaissance's connection with the development of jazz relating the career of Duke Ellington at Harlem's white-patrons-only Cotton Club and his influence on Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw.

While a quarter of the nation's workforce is without work jazz musicians thrive. The advent of a new dance called the Lindy Hop brings audiences to legendary dance halls like the Savoy Ballroom to swing with Chick Webb's big band. Fats Waller and Art Tatum take solo piano to new heights of virtuosity and Duke Ellington now being compared to Stravinsky transcends racial stereotypes while touring the country. Then at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles a struggling and brilliant clarinetist leads his band on stage and starts up a Fletcher Henderson arrangement.

Swing music is now the most popular music of the time. Young fans flock to dance halls to swing their troubles away. Bandleaders such as Benny Goodman Tommy Dorsey Jimmie Lunceford and Artie Shaw are worshipped by their fans like matinee idols. Then Goodman risking his career forms the first racially integrated jazz group with the brilliant pianist Teddy Wilson. Meanwhile Billie Holiday emerges from a rough childhood and is soon heralded as one of the greatest jazz vocalists ever. As 1937 comes to an end Goodman heads to the Savoy Ballroom for what is billed as "The Music Battle of the Century" -- a musical face-off with Chick Webb's big band. Despite the tough competition it's obvious to the many dancers on the floor who is the true "King of Swing.", Keith David | Wynton Marsalis, Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 6: Swing - The Velocity of Celebration 1937-1939 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 8: Risk 1945-1946 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 10: A Masterpiece by Midnight 1961-Present | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 3: Our Language 1924-1928 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 7: Dedicated to Chaos 1940-1945 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 4: The True Welcome 1929-1935

Soon an exciting new swing sound infused with the blues and centered around improvisation is reinvigorating jazz audiences and musicians alike. The focal point of this movement is Kansas City and Count Basie's band leads the charge of the "Territory Bands" -- so-called because of their mid-western roots. Kansas City swing enters the spotlight in 1938 when Basie's band performs alongside Benny Goodman's at Carnegie Hall. Soon after the set the group travels uptown to the Savoy Ballroom and a legendary battle of the bands with Chick Webb. By the end of the '30s Basie's lead saxophonist Lester Young has risen to the forefront of jazz and with a laid-back mellow approach that will influence such later jazz luminaries as Miles Davis. Young also pairs with Billie Holiday who eventually records the incendiary anti-lynching ballad "Strange Fruit". By the decade's end Chick Webb similarly garners fame and fortune with a young singer named Ella Fitzgerald and as war breaks out in Europe Coleman Hawkins records the ballad "Body and Soul" in such a way that prefigures the sound of jazz to come., Keith David | Wynton Marsalis, Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 7: Dedicated to Chaos 1940-1945 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 8: Risk 1945-1946 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 10: A Masterpiece by Midnight 1961-Present | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 3: Our Language 1924-1928 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 5: Swing - Pure Pleasure 1935-1937 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 4: The True Welcome 1929-1935

Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw enlist in the armed forces and take their bands overseas to entertain the troops. Hitler bans jazz in Germany despite -- or rather because of -- its underground popularity with "swing kids." Yet as jazz serves as a symbol of American democracy in Europe many black Americans still aren't allowed to hear freedom swing. The Savoy Ballroom is closed down to keep white servicemen from its integrated swing dances and riots ensue. Despite the hypocrisy of the era Duke Ellington sells war bonds and pairs with a brilliant young composer named Billy Strayhorn to write some of the most compelling work of his career. Meanwhile a cadre of young musicians gathering nightly at a Harlem club discover a new way to play jazz: As the war comes to an end and the recording ban is lifted trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker record the song "Ko Ko" based on the chords to "Cherokee." Thus "bebop" takes Americans by surprise and propels jazz in a whole new direction., Keith David | Wynton Marsalis, Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 8: Risk 1945-1946 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 6: Swing - The Velocity of Celebration 1937-1939 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 10: A Masterpiece by Midnight 1961-Present | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 3: Our Language 1924-1928 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 5: Swing - Pure Pleasure 1935-1937 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 4: The True Welcome 1929-1935

Charlie "Bird" Parker garners legions of devoted followers who imitate not only his brilliant soloing but also his heroin addiction -- a problem that will plague jazz through the 1950s. As the big bands fade small-group jazz becomes de rigeur: dancing is out and experimentation is in. Dizzy Gillespie infuses bebop with Latin rhythms employing congero Chano Pozo. And pianist Thelonious Monk creates angular and percussive jazz all his own. Despite this surge in creativity most people prefer the new simpler dance-oriented rhythm & blues of artists like Louis Jordan. Meanwhile in California jazz musicians influence a mellow album featuring the arrangements of Gil Evans and the trumpet of Miles Davis creating what is soon called "cool" jazz. Dave Brubeck helps lead the charge by recording his million-selling album "Time Out". But as the '50s wear on Davis moves away from cool jazz and begins his own creative journey as the "pied piper" of jazz., Keith David | Wynton Marsalis, A Great Day in Harlem | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 9: The Adventure 1956-1961 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 6: Swing - The Velocity of Celebration 1937-1939 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 10: A Masterpiece by Midnight 1961-Present | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 3: Our Language 1924-1928 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 5: Swing - Pure Pleasure 1935-1937

The same year that Elvis Presley tops the pop charts Duke Ellington records a live album at the Newport Jazz Festival that outsells all his others. Other aging artists' careers soon burn out as a result of drugs as well as competition from young virtuosos such as Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey and his Jazz Messengers. Yet these progressive young musicians remain silent as Louis Armstrong -- whom they unfairly label an "Uncle Tom" -- condemns the government's failure to act against racism in Little Rock AK. Still the leading visionary of jazz with his minimalist approach Miles Davis continues to put together different groups throughout the late '50s. But as the '60s approach it is one of Davis' sidemen saxophonist John Coltrane who envisions the future of jazz with his provocative version of "My Favorite Things.", Keith David | Wynton Marsalis, Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 10: A Masterpiece by Midnight 1961-Present | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 8: Risk 1945-1946 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 6: Swing - The Velocity of Celebration 1937-1939 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 3: Our Language 1924-1928 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 5: Swing - Pure Pleasure 1935-1937 | Ken Burns' Jazz Episode 7: Dedicated to Chaos 1940-1945

Despite Louis Armstrong outselling the Beatles with Hello Dolly most jazz musicians are scuffling to find work let alone be heard. Most young people listen to rock music. The "free jazz" of artists such as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman takes the music in increasingly avant-garde -- and non-commercial -- directions. Musicians and critics alike begin to debate the future and tradition of jazz. In typical fashion Miles Davis at once illuminates and compounds the issue with Bitches Brew his landmark fusion album. Toward the end of the 1970s the deaths of both Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington seemed to mark the end of the development of jazz. But the prodigal return of saxophonist Dexter Gordon from Europe incited a new generation to revisit the jazz of the past and rejuvenate the music. Soon a virtuosic young trumpeter proficient in both classical and jazz music is leading the movement to bring the tradition of jazz full circle.

George (Tom McCamus) is a man who possesses an unusual level of awareness -- he not only understands that people exist in parallel worlds at once but also is able to experience several of his alternate lives at once even remembering what happened on one plane of existence while functioning in another. This is as much of a curse as a blessing for George; his wife Joyce (Tilda Swinton) was murdered in one life and he finds himself thrown from one life to another in which he encounters Joyce's other lives while he searches for her killer. As we're introduced to George he's been murdered and his brain has been removed from his body; Berkley (Sean McCann) a veteran police detective is assigned to investigate the killing with his less experienced partner Williams (Rick Miller). Berkley and Williams are eventually led to a laboratory run by an eccentric scientist who performs odd experiments on animal brains and studies the effects of sensory deprivation. Meanwhile George still lives in another parallel world where he meets Joyce again -- not once but twice.

Dillon owns nearly every business of consequence in the town of Kingdom Come; if someone wants to dig for gold rent a room open a bank account or even order a drink they have to go to Dillon to do it. One of the few profitable enterprises in town that he doesn't own is the brothel which is operated by Lucia (Milla Jovovich) Dillon's lover. Circumstances change somewhat when Dalglish - a surveyor with the Central Pacific Railroad - turns up and expresses his plans to implement a railroad in the area. Dillon sensing a great opportunity afoot travels well out of his way to ensure that the line is run through Kingdom Come to enhance the town's commercial prospects. Also arriving in town the same time as Dalglish are two women the beautiful but ailing Elena (Nastassja Kinski) and her lovely teenage daughter Hope (Sarah Polley); their presence is deeply troubling for Dillon for they are the keys to a dark secret Dillon has kept from the people of Kingdom Come.

Set in a dystopian future as imagined by a 1920s Soviet filmmaker the movie is of a venerable genre -- a love story (in this case a love triangle) played out against the backdrop of a catastrophic event. The hyperactive epic opens with an introduction to the characters: two brothers Nikolai a mortician and Osip an actor in a Passion Play both of whom are in love with Anna a state scientist. Anna's conundrum is compounded by her latest scientific discovery: the Earth's heart is failing and humanity has one day left. Chaos ensues as people prepare for the apocalypse and as the brothers compete for Anna's love. However a third man appears Akmatov an industrialist. As riots and orgies break out Anna falls under the spell of the capitalist oblivious to the world's tumult. At the last minute she comes to her senses and frees herself from the industrialist's grasp. With the heart of the world on the brink of failure Anna devises a radical remedy that leads to the Earth's rescue and a rousing climax. This highly praised short premiered at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival as part of its "Preludes" series of shorts played before feature films.

When Luo suggests that the coffin should be brought home from the hospital on a tractor his aging mother Zhao Di (Zhao Yuelin) rebuffs him insisting that they conform to custom and have it carried home by local men.

A young beautiful Zhao Di (Zhang Ziyi) find herself falling for the village's handsome new teacher Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao). As the males in the village join together to build a school for the burg Zhao Di helps the other women prepare food waiting patiently to meet the strapping educator.

In 1941 Pollock (Ed Harris) was a bitter and struggling painter when he met Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden) a fellow artist with whom he was appearing in a joint gallery show. Krasner was intrigued by Pollock and immediately sensed the importance of his work; they quickly became lovers and as Krasner realized his superior talent she began devoting herself to promoting Pollock's work. When Peggy Guggenheim (Amy Madigan) agreed to present a show of Pollock's paintings at her Art of This Century gallery his name was made and a profile in Life magazine solidified his reputation as one of the art world's most important figures. But success did not bring Pollock peace of mind; while he long had a taste for alcohol his new fame sent his drinking out of control and his infidelity with numerous women (including Guggenheim) eventually destroyed his relationship with Krasner. Pollock was the first feature directed by actor Ed Harris who also plays the title role; the cast also includes Val Kilmer as artist Willem de Kooning and Jennifer Connelly as Ruth Kligman one of Pollock's lovers., Ed Harris | Marcia Gay Harden | Amy Madigan | Jennifer Connelly | Jeffrey Tambor | Bud Cort | John Heard | Val Kilmer | Barbara Garrick, Girl With a Pearl Earring | Young Goethe in Love | Lust for Life | Basquiat | Black Butterflies | Surviving Picasso

Gary McCullogh (T.K. Carter) was once a hard-working man with an education and a solid career but after succumbing to the lure of heroin Gary has lost his job home and wife -- and now steals whatever he can find to support his habit. Gary lives with his girlfriend Fran Boyd (Khandi Alexander) who is also addicted to heroin. While she's all too aware of the pitfalls of her life and wants to clean up she has trouble getting medical help and her willpower is too weak for her to kick the habit by herself. Fran's 15-year-old son DeAndre (Sean Nelson) has seen enough of his mother's troubles to be wary of using drugs but while he would prefer to stay on the straight and narrow dealing crack is one of the few job options open to him in his neighborhood especially after his allergy to seafood causes him to lose a job in a restaurant. The Corner was based on the book of the same name by Edward Burns and David Simon which examined one year in a real-life Baltimore neighborhood; Simon collaborated on the teleplay with David Mills and noted actor Charles S.

The story is straightforward -- Marianne Vogler (Lena Endre) is a beautiful actress who is married to Markus (Thomas Hanzon) whose job as an orchestra conductor requires numerous concerts abroad and who dotes on their young daughter Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo). Yet when Marianne has an affair with family friend David (Kirster Henriksson) a film director with a volcanic temper and little regard to those around him the fallout destroys the marriage and brings grief and suffering to all involved particularly Isabelle. Ullman and Bergman frame this plot with a tale about an elderly director named Bergman (Erland Josephson who played opposite Ullman in Bergman's landmark Scenes from a Marriage) who is trying to write a script about infidelity. In his austerely decorated house on a remote island Bergman invites an actress who may or may not be a figment of his imagination to breathe life into the character of Marianne. The actress tells Bergman of Marianne's story through flashbacks. One evening on the closing night of the play that Marianne was in -- and while Markus is abroad -- David arrives for dinner with her and ultimately sleeps platonically in her bed. This unplanned intimacy soon leads to a full blown affair including a three week romantic getaway to Paris. When Markus finally discovers the couple in flagrante delicto he demands an immediate divorce and custody of their daughter.

The expedition took place in 1992 and Stiever uses video footage and still photos of the trip excerpts from Bancroft's diary and interviews with the team to document the event. Bancroft carefully assembled her team consisting of herself and three other women only to see one of the women drop out after a grueling practice trip across Greenland. Veteran mountaineer Sue Giller was the navigator expert skier Anne Dal Vara was on the team and Bancroft forced to come up with a replacement for the fourth team member chose Sunniva Sorby who was younger and less experienced than the other team members but had a very positive attitude. The team ran into trouble trying to get corporate sponsorship for their trip. They went to about 250 corporations with little success. The corporations were reluctant to fund them because they didn't think the women would make it. There was also homophobia involved as at least one member of the team was an out lesbian. With a surprising amount of support from grassroots private donors the team sets out on their journey. Stiever contrasts the camaraderie and teamwork of the women with the more competitive attitude of a two-man British team engaged in a similar trek. "Their approach was more to conquer" says Sorby "and ours was more to experience.", ,

In 1979 China is beginning to reinvent itself in the wake of the Cultural Revolution and change is slowly but surely coming to Fenyang a small town in the Shanxi province. The influences of the West (pop music longer hair for men television privatization) and the adoption of more modern social conventions (birth control co-habitation the abandonment of the arranged marriage) begin to slowly manifest themselves in Fenyang and two young people Minliang (Wang Hong-wei) and Chang Jun (Liang Jing-dong) find their own lives beginning to change. Chang Jun becomes involved with Zhong Pin (Yang Tian-yi) and they decide to move in together which is still against the law and earns them the enmity of their parents. Minliang meanwhile openly declares his affections to Ruijuan (Zhao Tao) who finds her own feelings about him carrying greater weight than her father's stern objections. The times also change for the musical group  as they shift from the state-sanctioned political material that had been their staple to Westernized pop music but they find themselves in a no-man's-land as there is little audience for either their old repertoire or their new material.

The film is based on Scott's earlier theatrical production of the same play with several of the same actors repeating their same roles. Updated to 1900 New York the text remains substantially the same as it has always been: Hamlet (Scott) the "melancholy" Danish prince discovers to his horror that his late father the King was murdered by his brother (and Hamlet's uncle) Claudius (Jamey Sheridan) who upon ascending to the throne added insult to injury by wedding Hamlet's mother Gertrude (Blair Brown). Though his desire for revenge is strong Hamlet does not want any more bloodshed and concocts an elaborate scheme to "catch the conscience" of Claudius and force him into a confession. Part of this scheme involves Hamlet's feigned descent into madness -- which as interpreted by Scott may not be as "feigned" as he thinks it is. Caught in the middle of this intrigue is Hamlet's lady love Ophelia (Lisa Gay Hamilton) daughter of Claudius' chief consul Polonius (played in the manner of a protocol-conscious Victorian diplomat by Roscoe Lee Browne). Some of the choices made by Scott in adapting Hamlet to the screen -- the turn-of-the-century setting; the utilization of black actors in the roles of Polonius Ophelia and Laertes (who is played by Roger Guenveur Smith); the casting of Byron Jennings to play both the Ghost of Hamlet's father and the Player King who pretends to be the father -- were applauded by the critics. Other innovations notably the use of slow jazz music throughout the action and Hamlet's violent treatment of poor Ophelia during the "Get thee to a nunnery" scene were not so enthusiastically received. Whatever the case Scott does a remarkable job with a tiny budget and a slim 29-day shooting schedule. In addition to the actors' lilting interpretation of the Shakespearean dialogue and soliloquies the film boasts a truly exciting climactic duel shot in long takes without the use of stunt doubles. Initially produced for a theatrical release this Hamlet made its American debut as a cable TV miniseries on the Odyssey Channel beginning December 10 2000., Campbell Scott | Blair Brown | Jamey Sheridan | Roscoe Lee Browne | Lisa Gay Hamilton | Roger Guenveur Smith | Sam Robards | John Benjamin Hickey | Michael Imperioli | Marcus Giamatti | Maureen Anderman | Jim Gaffigan | Earl Hindman | Christina Kirk | J.C.

However while Hatori sees surfing -- and the making of this film -- as a means of reaching a higher plane his crew and the surfers he's brought along for a trip to some of the world's most spectacular surf spots (including Christian Enns Stephen Slater and Veronica Kay) seem to have a narrower view of the sport which leads to some conflicts between Hatori and his collaborators.

Delicately handsome Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) has come to a seaside resort town with his sisters Annick (Marie Matheron) and Sarah (Laetitia Legrix) and his mother (Dominique Reymond) who has suffered from a crippling depression ever since her newborn baby died of cancer. One day while sunning himself on the beach with Sarah Mathieu notices the attentions of Cedric (Stephane Rideau) a sturdy handsome slightly older youth. The two quickly develop an illicit romance spending their days combing the beach and their evenings slipping off for passionate sex. Cedric it turns out has dropped out of school and after a brief stint as a rent boy and a failed relationship with a boy named Pierre (Nils Ohlund) moved over one town and settled into a comfortable routine of blue-collar work. The sturdy good-natured Cedric charms Mathieu's family but the true nature of the youths' relationship soon becomes apparent leading to conflict especially with oldest sibling Annick. Mathieu's biggest problem however is his sense of powerlessness over his mother's illness and the death in the family. The scenes of his romance with Cedric are interspersed with scenes from two later time periods. In one setting we witness Mathieu's recovery from a suicide attempt and subsequent refusal to accept Cedric's visits; in another we see Mathieu return alone to the site of his sexual coming of age.

Dick who was famous for creating tales that centered around questions of identity often pertaining to the real versus unreal and human versus machine. In the film several luminaries discuss Dick's impact on society and how it affected popular art such as Robert Anton Wilson author of the Illuminati trilogy and Paul Williams who profiled the author in a 1974 Rolling Stone article that was a catalyst for his elevation amongst fans. Considered an underground writer Dick built a steady fan base of devout readers and ardent admirers. Just before his period of recognizable fame the author (portrayed here as a recreational drug user) was burgled and his private safe was blown open with explosives; the vault was later widely believed to be stashed with heroin with the heist possibly masterminded by a young addict -- who could have been among the group of young people Dick frequently harbored in the early 1970s. Dick also attempted suicide and firmly believed the "Xerox missive" (a letter) would contribute to his death. At the end of his career the author was plagued by visions that all but forced him to give up on his "Exegesis" a tome equaling roughly over 10000 pages that detailed his ruminations on the meaning of life.

Set during the 1950s in Staten Island the film charts the financial failures of Buddy (Michael Rispoli) a nice-guy entrepreneur who has perpetual bad luck. While he was in the army he sang songs on stage to bolster troop morale. During one performance he received a warm reception from none other than Arthur Godfrey who invited him to audition when he got back to the U.S. After the war Buddy's crushingly pragmatic wife Estelle (Katherine Narducci) along with her very traditional parents dissuade him from a life in showbiz. After a decade of living with Estelle's parents and failing repeatedly at one get-rich-quick scheme after another Buddy buys a rundown house with the idea of refurbishing the second floor for living quarters and the first for a pizzeria where he can sing. Estelle grudgingly goes along with it secretly hoping that this plan will fail so disastrously that he will stop dreaming and lead a "normal" life. Not until he finalizes the purchase does Buddy realize that the house has a pair of squatters: Jim (Kevin Conway) a drunken Irish immigrant and his much younger very pregnant girlfriend Mary (Kelly Macdonald). Buddy tries to evict the recalcitrant drunkard but he refuses to leave. Just as matters are about to come to fisticuffs Mary goes into labor. To the surprise of everyone the child is of mixed raced -- the product of a brief tryst that Mary had with an African-American man a while back. Disgusted and disappointed Jim shuffles off never to be seen. Buddy hasn't quite the heart to evict a young single mother nor the strength to resist his wife's perpetual nagging so he quietly pays for a room in a neighborhood boarding house. Though Mary is initially very mistrustful of Buddy's intentions the two slowly realize that they are in fact soul mates.

In 1973 many of the men of Harlan County Kentucky were employed by Brookside Mining who operated a number of coal mines. Brookside paid its employees meager wages for dangerous backbreaking work and also controlled housing and retail sales in the area boarding its workers in shacks without central heating or indoor plumbing and selling them food and clothing at inflated prices. Warren Jakopovich (Stellan Skarsgard) an organizer for the United Mine Workers Association encouraged Brookside's workers to join the union and go on strike for fair wages and better working conditions. Many of the miners simply couldn't afford the loss of income that a strike would mean but when two workers died as a result of Brookside's willful ignorance of safety standards most of Harlan County's mine workers finally went on strike. A judge formerly employed by Brookside handed down an order forbidding the workers to picket the mine sites but Ruby Kincaid (Holly Hunter) whose husband Silas (Ted Levine) was fired for protesting dangerous conditions and whose father was attacked by scab laborers organized the wives of striking miners to picket in their place.

Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) is an astute Harvard-educated African-American writer working for an independent television network who is assigned to brainstorm a new show for the African-American audience. Delacroix is the only black writer on the network's staff and the longer he works under Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport) the loudmouthed executive in charge of programming the more he's convinced he's made a mistake. Wanting to be fired Delacroix writes a pilot he imagines is so offensive no network would ever dare to air it: "The ManTan Minstrel Show" in which dancer Man Ray (Savion Glover) and comedian Womack (Tommy Davidson) portray two shiftless dunderheads ManTan and Sleep 'N Eat -- who are to be played in blackface. To Delacroix's surprise Dunwitty gives the idea the go-ahead and to his shock the show is soon a massive hit. Delacroix is now stuck trying to explain his show to the African-American community who are generally not amused especially Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith) his assistant on the staff who has become involved with Man Ray. In order to give Bamboozled a look that would suit its setting in the world of network television Spike Lee and cinematographer Ellen Kuras shot the entire film using digital video equipment., Damon Wayans | Savion Glover | Jada Pinkett Smith | Tommy Davidson | Michael Rapaport | Thomas Jefferson Byrd | Paul Mooney | Sarah Stacker Jones | Gillian Iliana Waters | Susan Batson | Mos Def | Kim Director, Hollywood Shuffle | Black and White | The Great White Hype | The Producers | This Revolution | D.R.O.P.

In the first group are friends and business partners Turkish (Jason Statham who also supplies the film's voice-over narration) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) who join up with Mickey (Brad Pitt) an Irish gypsy and boxer. Turkish and Tommy make arrangements with Mickey to take a fall in a match engineered by lunatic gang leader Brick Top (Alan Ford). In another corner resides equally loony Russian gangster Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia) who has asked Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) to place a bet on the match for him. Boris is also scheming to have Sol (Lennie James) the owner of a pawn shop rob the place with a couple of dim associates.

Curtis spent 30 years at great financial and personal cost doggedly photographing 80 different Indian tribes just as their customs and culture were being eroded by the prevalence of white culture eventually resulting in the ethnographic landmark 20-volume work The North American Indian. Anne Makepeace directs this poignant sensitive documentary about one man willing to risk his family and fortune for this one Herculean effort. A successful society photographer in Seattle in the 1890s Curtis became entranced by Native American culture during a trip to Alaska and was inspired to photograph them in their traditional garb where they live. In 1900 he garnered notice when he managed to photograph the heretofore forbidden Peigan sun dance and managed to get financial backing from Theodore Roosevelt and J.P. Morgan to start his life's work. Spending long months away from his wife and children in Seattle Curtis journeyed to remote corners of the country with literally a ton of equipment in tow and to New York to over see the printing of his books. He had only published eight volumes of his work when Morgan's money ceased coming in -- and due to WWI and a shift in national tastes financial support was difficult to find. At the same time Curtis' wife divorced him cleaning him out of most of his assets. By the 1920s Curtis found work in Hollywood as a still photographer working on the set of Cecil B. De Mille's The Ten Commandments. Alarmed by the degree to which Indian culture was disappearing he quit his movie industry gig and went out into the field one final time in 1927. Three years later Curtis published the final volume of his work. Edward S. Curtis died anonymous and impoverished in 1952 in L.A.

The youth unfortunately mistakes the Prince's preachy self-absorption for paternal interest and is thus crestfallen when his erstwhile mentor adopts rich relative Guido Lanza (Giorgio Lupano) as his heir. As the film progresses a quiet rivalry builds between the youths.

Rabbi Meltzer (Asi Dayan) is a respected Orthodox rabbi and leader of a yeshiva school in a remote section of the Judean hills. One of the Rabbi's favorite causes is returning Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock to the control of Israel -- a holy shrine in the ancient city that Moslems use as a mosque and Jews call Temple Mount. With this goal in mind the Rabbi organizes a military unit comprised of his students with military officer Menachem (Aki Avni) serving as an advisor. While Menachem agrees with Rabbi Meltzer in principle especially since the Rabbi regards the group's activities as more symbolic than anything else he and other military authorities are wary of his plan believing the Rabbi's soldiers could easily turn into a fanatical terrorist group with the wrong twist of the political winds. One of the Rabbi's prize students is a frail young man named Pini (Edan Alterman) and Meltzer is fond enough of the lad that he's decided Pini should wed his daughter Michal (Tinkerbell). But while Michal respects her father she has a mind of her own and no interest in marrying Pini. Instead Michal has become infatuated with Menachem but the officer refuses to go against the Rabbi's wishes; determined to follow her heart Michal leaves home to strike out on her own. Pini is devastated by Michal's departure and he becomes newly determined to make good within Rabbi Meltzer's military unit while mapping out a secret plan with fellow student Itamar (Micha Selektar) in which they'll finally destroy the Dome of the Rock. Time of Favor won wide acclaim in Israel earning six Israeli Academy awards including Best Picture and it was the nation's official entry for the 2000 American Academy Awards competition (though it failed to make it into the final field of nominees)., Aki Avni | Micha Selektar | Samuel Calderon, The Spook Who Sat by the Door | Reise der Hoffnung | El Norte | Paradise Now | Apollo 13 | All the President's Men

While Claire's contention that someone or something sinister is afoot leads her down a number of blind alleys in time she becomes convinced that the mysterious happenings at her home are somehow connected to the disappearance of a woman who was a student at the nearby college -- and bore a striking resemblance to Claire. What Lies Beneath marked the debut of screenwriter Clark Gregg whose script is based on a story by himself and Sarah Kernochan; the supporting cast includes Diana Scarwid as Claire's best friend Jody and James Remar and Miranda Otto as a contentious couple living next door., Harrison Ford | Michelle Pfeiffer | Diana Scarwid | Miranda Otto | James Remar | Joe Morton | Amber Valletta | Victoria Bidewell | Katharine Towne | Ray Baker | Mitch Carter | Wendy Crewson | Tom Dahlgren | Moosie Drier | Bridget Hoffman | Donna Lynn Leavy | Micole Mercurio | Edie Mirman | Sloane Shelton | Daniel Zelman | Rachel Singer | Philece Sampler | Jennifer Tung | David Cowgill | Eliott Goretsky | Dennison Samaroo, The Changeling | Silent Hill: Revelation | The Sixth Sense | Presumed Innocent | Mama | The Stepford Wives

Katsuhiko (Koji Yakusho) is a mild-mannered sound-technician who is married to Junco (Jun Fubuki). While at first glance Junco seems to be an average hausfrau she possesses great clairvoyant powers. Though she has slowly and quietly built a reputation as a medium she proves to be completely incapable of working in a normal service industry job; she has the unfortunately tendency of being able to see the crimes of her patrons. Katsuhiko is aware of her unusual abilities but prefers to think of her as "normal." Young psychology graduate student Hayakawa (Teuyoshi Kusanagi) invites Junco to join his study on the paranormal. At the same time the police are desperately searching for a young girl who was kidnapped by an ex-cop turned pervert. At Hayakawa's behest the cops consult with Junco as to the child's whereabouts. Ironically enough the girl escapes her captor and takes refuge in Katsuhiko's equipment case while he records sounds in the mountains. The next day Junco's psychic sonar goes off and she discovers the missing child in their garage. This freak happenstance awakens a long-dormant ambition in Junco: convinced that her discovery was not a striking enough find she hatches an ill-conceived scheme to make it seem more dramatic. While Katsuhiko tends to the unconscious girl Junco scatters clues throughout the western suburbs of Tokyo and then informs the police of her psychic "insights." As the film progresses their plan goes awry and the child meets a bad end. Junco's abilities boomerang on her and soon she and Katsuhiko are haunted by the ghost of the girl.

This documentary uses interviews archival footage and an entertaining style to look at Herer's life -- including his early days as a Goldwater Republican his stint as a "political prisoner" during the Reagan era and historic protests and key moments in the controversy over cannabis. Herer expresses a concern that when hemp was outlawed in the 1930s the pressure for the ban came from political insiders and wealthy business interests that were focused more on profit and power than on public safety or morality -- which may have imposed an exaggerated negative slant on the use of hemp in the guise of concern about the use of marijuana as a drug. The film provides background on the effective practical worldwide use of hemp for manufacture of paper products rope and other basic materials -- suggesting that U.S. industry could shift toward using hemp for fiber and oil-based products instead of relying on timber petroleum and less-renewable resources.

While the opera is set in China during the Ming Dynasty Mehta's desire was to stage a version that relied less on outmoded stereotypes and more on the realities of life in China during that period. Working with Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou Mehta staged an acclaimed new production of Turandot in Italy. A year later Mehta and Yimou began an even more ambitious plan -- to bring their Turandot to China where it would be performed with a massive cast of Italian and Chinese performers on an outdoor stage at the fabled Forbidden City. In The Turandot Project documentary filmmaker Allan Miller captures the long and often difficult process by which Puccini's opera was brought back to the land that inspired it -- and the considerable culture shock both the Italian and Chinese artists suffered along the way.

The phenomenon of daycare and at-home nannies formally was one for only the rich but now middle-class working mothers are finding outside caregivers. 20th Century With Mike Wallace tells the story of how British nanny Louise Woodward changed the entire scope of childcare after she was accused of killing the child placed in her care.

Around this same time Charlie notices a mysterious tattooed stranger and the two exchange looks. Intrigued Charlie sets out looking for the man and in the process he launches himself on a nightmarish journey through the underside of New York.

As a teenager Louis XIV (played by Emil Tarding) was the ostensive ruler of France but his mother Anne of Austria (Colette Emmanuelle) made most of the decisions while Louis staged elaborate dance pieces set to the music of Lully (Boris Terral). When Lully was forced to leave Italy he found an eager patron in young Louis who loved his music and was fascinated by the flamboyant composer and his libertine ways. Years later after Louis XIV had grown to adulthood the more mature ruler (now played by Benoit Magimel) took control of France's political and military affairs to the annoyance of the Prince de Conti (Idwig Stephane) who had been Anne of Austria's top advisor. But as Louis confronted his European neighbors he also established a French dance academy and commissioned Lully to write a number of new dance scores. Lully's flamboyant nature and open infidelity with both men and women earned him the enmity of the more conservative members of Louis XIV's court but the King remained Lully's champion until health problems began to affect his ability to dance -- causing him to lose interest in performance as well as in Lully's music. Le Roi Danse also explores Lully's relationship with Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere with Tcheky Karyo portraying the great playwright., Boris Terral | Colette Emmanuelle | Cecile Bois | Claire Keim | Johan Leysen | Idwig Stephane | Emil Tarding | Jacques Francois, Let Joy Reign Supreme . . . | All the Mornings of the World | Vatel | Yankee Doodle Dandy | Funny Girl | Amadeus

Even the conspicuous "There Is Still Time" banner -- warning humankind to abandon nuclear weapons -- is there. The similarities between the films are understandable: Their directors (Stanley Kramer 1959) and Russell Mulcahy 2000) based their productions on novelist Nevil Shute's On the Beach and used the same scriptwriter John Paxton although writers David Williamson and Bill Kerby doctored Paxton's work. Of course the newer version set in 2006 exhibits updated technology including a snazzy submarine with blinking computers. Moreover it appends incidental scenes -- like a whole family driving off a cliff -- to show that it isn't easy to face the end of the world. Armand Assante does an okay job as Dwight Towers the American submarine commander who pulls up at the only land mass not littered with corpses Australia. Most of the other actors -- Rachel Ward as Moira Davidson Grant Bowler as Peter Holmes Jacqueline McKenzie as Mary Holmes and Steve Bastoni as Neil Hirsch -- also perform capably. However Bryan Browne is annoying as know-it-all scientist Julian Osborne who prefers to curse complain and drink his way into the great beyond. Director Mulcahy mars the film by distilling end-of-the-world tension into quotidian melodrama in which Towers (Assante) woos and wins Browne's girlfriend Moira (Ward) and Moira and her sister quarrel over which one was the favorite of their parents. The ending of the film is chilling but mawkish.
