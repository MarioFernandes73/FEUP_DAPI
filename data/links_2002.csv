Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a gifted classical pianist born to a wealthy Jewish family in Poland. The Szpilmans have a large and comfortable flat in Warsaw which Wladyslaw shares with his mother and father (Maureen Lipman and Frank Finlay) his sisters Halina and Regina (Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner) and his brother Henryk (Ed Stoppard). While Wladyslaw and his family are aware of the looming presence of German forces and Hitler's designs on Poland they're convinced that the Nazis are a menace which will pass and that England and France will step forward to aid Poland in the event of a real crisis. Wladyslaw's naïveté is shattered when a German bomb rips through a radio studio while he performs a recital for broadcast. During the early stages of the Nazi occupation as a respected artist he still imagines himself above the danger using his pull to obtain employment papers for his father and landing a supposedly safe job playing piano in a restaurant. But as the German grip tightens upon Poland Wladyslaw and his family are selected for deportation to a Nazi concentration camp. Refusing to face a certain death Wladyslaw goes into hiding in a comfortable apartment provided by a friend. However when his benefactor goes missing Wladyslaw is left to fend for himself and he spends the next several years dashing from one abandoned home to another desperate to avoid capture by German occupation troops. The Pianist was based on the memoir of the same name by the real-life Wladyslaw Szpilman; the book was first published in 1946 as Death of a City but was banned by Polish Communist officials and went out of print until 1998 when a new edition was issued as The Pianist., , The Book Thief | In Darkness | Free Men | Max Manus | Battle of Warsaw 1920 | Europa Europa

However Fred strings Roxie along a bit too far for his own good and when she realizes that his promises are empty she becomes enraged and murders Fred in cold blood. Roxie soon finds herself behind bars alongside Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a sexy vaudeville star who used to perform with her sister until Velma discovered that her sister had been sleeping with her husband.

Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is a gifted but profoundly neurotic screenwriter who after the success of Being John Malkovich has been hired to write a script adapted from the nonfiction book The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean. But while Charlie is obsessive about his work he's also intensely paranoid given to deep depression socially inept and terrified of talking to women qualities which are making it difficult to get on with his work or hold on to his tenuous relationship with girlfriend Amelia (Cara Seymour). Meanwhile Charlie's identical twin brother Donald Kaufman (also played by Cage) has shown up to move in with his brother. Emotionally Donald is Charlie's polar opposite -- a loudmouthed over-confident superficial party animal who has an easy way with the ladies. Donald has decided to follow his brother's footsteps and take up screenwriting as well but embracing the dictates of screenwriting tutor Robert McKee (Brian Cox) he's cranking out a cliché-ridden serial-killer thriller when not busy making time with new girlfriend Caroline (Maggie Gyllenhaal). As Donald blazes through his screenplay Charlie slowly picks away at his story in which author Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep) chronicles John Laroche (Chris Cooper) a scruffy but devoted plant enthusiast who tries to save rare species of orchids by stealing them from their natural home in the swamps of Florida. As John and Susan become better acquainted they find themselves attracted to one another; similarly Charlie finds himself increasingly fascinated with Susan and finds himself falling in love with her even though he's only seen her photo on the dust jacket of her book. Charlie arranges to meet Susan but is too nervous to confront her face to face so he sends Donald (who has just scored a seven-figure deal for his script) in his place while he attends a screenwriting seminar held by McKee.

Arnold was an outgoing and well-liked schoolteacher with an interest in electronics who also ran a private computer school out of their home. Elaine a reserved but caring woman helped look after the couple's three sons Jesse Seth and David. All appeared to be happy in their lives until November 1987 when police raided the Friedman home after Arnold and Jesse were accused of multiple counts of child molestation. A search revealed that Arnold owned a sizable collection of child pornography and he confessed to some of the charges placed against him; Jesse however firmly insisted he was innocent. As the investigation against the Friedmans went on public opinion regarding the case became more and more heated but not all of the testimony against Arnold and Jesse matched up and some began to wonder just how many of the charges filed against the family had merit. Remarkably enough in the midst of these crises which threatened to destroy the family from within the Friedmans continued to take part in one of their favorite pastimes -- shooting home videos of their day-to-day lives offering a fly-on-the-wall look at a family struggling (and often failing) to hold themselves together in the wake of unthinkable accusations. Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki not only documented the legal and emotional struggles of the Friedman family with his own cameras but was given access to the family's archive of home videos and the result was Capturing the Friedmans a documentary which keeps its primary focus on the Friedman family while also investigating the merits or faults in the charges levied against them.

Their paths collide when Will deciding that single mothers are the easiest romantic conquests on the dating scene fabricates a two-year-old son and joins a group called S.P.A.T. (Single Parents Alone Together). Marcus is wise to Will's scheme however and through some incessant pestering and blackmail he contrives for Will to date Fiona. Though Will doesn't hit it off immediately with either Marcus or his mother he gradually begins to open up to the people around him -- so much so that he attracts the attention of another attractive single mom (Rachel Weisz).

Having already suffered the crippling effects of polio Kahlo sustains further injuries when a city bus accident nearly ends her life. But in her bed-ridden state the young artist produces dozens upon dozens of pieces; when she recovers she presents them to the legendary -- and legendarily temperamental -- Rivera (Alfred Molina) who takes her under his wing as an artist a political revolutionary and inevitably a lover. But their relationship is fraught with trouble as the philandering Rivera traverses the globe painting murals and Kahlo languishes in obscurity longing to make her mark on her own.

Hoping to make good on her own Lee begins looking for a job and in her free time indulges in her odd habit of inflicting pain upon herself in various ways. Lee is hired as a secretary by E. Edward Grey (James Spader) a grim and ruthlessly efficient attorney who warns her that her work will be both dull and demanding. Lee takes to the job with genuine enthusiasm and while she's recently acquired a new boyfriend Peter (Jeremy Davies) she's far more intrigued by Grey's coldly patrician demeanor. While Grey often criticizes Lee she seems to thrive on his abuse but one day he crosses a line when he insists upon spanking her after some minor mistake. Lee quite enjoys the treatment and wants it to continue but Grey can no longer take pleasure humiliating Lee when he knows that she likes it; he fires her despite her pleas to be allowed to stay. Finally discovering the key to her sexual and emotional needs Lee tries to persuade Peter to be rough with her but he simply doesn't have the taste or talent for it and Lee soon maps out a last-ditch effort to win back her position with Grey whatever the cost.

https://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-agronomist-v280970, The Agronomist, History, Biography Politics & Government Social History, Apr 23 2004, 9, Haiti USA, PG13, 9, , Jonathan Demme, Clinica Estetico, Clinica Estetico THINKFilm, Food for Thought, Members of the Press | Political Unrest, activism assassination Haiti human-rights husband-and-wife journalism pioneer profile [character] radio-personality radio-reporter social-justice, , Writer-director Jonathan Demme first visited Haiti in 1986 and reportedly fell in love with the nation. He felt intoxicated by the country's art music and its people - in whom he witnessed great passion and fervor and a yearning for political freedom. The close identification that Demme experienced with the Haitians informed two superb documentaries: Haiti Dreams of Democracy (1988) on the national struggle for liberation as exhibited through song and The Agronomist (2004) - a beautifully wrought and compelling biographical portait of Radio Haiti journalist Jean Léopold Dominique (1930-2000). For The Agronomist Demme filmed countless interviews with Jean and his wife Michelle from 1991 through 2000. Production spanned many phases in the lives of the Dominiques that included harassment and death threats by the Duvalier regime forced exile in New York and a return to Haiti under the leadership of Aristide. Ultimately circumstances brought the couple face-to-face with Aristide's dispiriting capacity for corruption and sellout. And not long after a tense and unfruitful radio interview that Dominique conducted with the former president the broadcaster met an assassin's bullet in the parking lot of Radio Haiti. In the film Demme shows us how Jean essentially provided a voice for the Haitian people in their native Creole despite mounting federal opposition. We learn that Dominique functioned as a beacon of truth who regularly countered the fallacies churned out by the fascistic Haitian government and its American allies. Jean's point was a fundamental one: like the muckraking journalist I.F. "Izzy" Stone he constantly reminded his listeners that all governments are mendacious and that the media - in his case the radio microphone - should act as a weapon. Radio played that role for him and also functioned as his art form. When he cut a perpetual swath through the brainwash of the Duvalier regime he essentially exercised Deb Eisenberg's maxim: "art is the opposite of propaganda - it ventures into distant ambiguities it dismantles the received information in your brain and expands and refines what you can experience." Demme must have sensed at an early stage that Jean Dominique would be a mesmerizing character to place at the center of a documentary and his instincts were dead on target. The documentarian shows us how Jean used his entire persona - not simply his broadcasts - as one giant revolutionary act. His life was a 70-year performance piece intended to rouse the Haitian working classes to action. Fittingly then he comes across as intense histrionic and passionate during interviews. There is a magnificent telling moment early in the film where Jean describes how the Haitian military turned its guns on the station in 1991. As Jean revels in the irony that he broadcast the sound of the gunshots to thousands of listeners and thereby countered propaganda that the troops were attempting to enforce with their rifles he flashes an impish smile at his own cleverness and throws his hands up in the air playfully. In this and other similar moments Demme shows us how Dominique thrived on the theatricality of provocation to such an extent that he would likely have found it difficult to live without drama. While Jean's adult daughter J.J. tells us that in his private life (off-air) he was emotionally inexpressive the broadcasts elicited an opposite quality: he sprang to life on the air energized and electrified by the microphone. We quickly deduce that Dominique was born to serve as an on-air catalyst a live wire in this beleaguered time and place. Michelle at one point likens her husband to Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and that simile feels apt. Demme's portrait of Dominique echoes other truth-speakers who were cruelly silenced: Dr. King and Mahatma Gandhi. There is a fascination a wonder inherent in the notion that extraordinary men occasionally rise up to help turn the tide of history and this film meditates on that truth and pays homage to it. Demme finds a visual apotheosis in the sight of a young boy holding a rope that he uses to pull an occupied toy trolley through the mud. It is doubtful that the filmmaker could have identifid a more potent metaphor for what Dominique accomplished via his remarkable relationship with the Haitian populace. Demme's approach throughout the documentary feels - on several levels - ingeniously calculated. One of his techniques involves withholding any mention of Dominique's assassination until the concluding fifteen or twenty minutes which fosters tighter bonds between the audience and the subject and sustains an undercurrent of hope. He also intuitively structures the material in tandem with both the trajectory of Dominique's life and the shifting currents of Haitian sociopolitical history to introduce and build on a fascinating theme: how the individual and social spheres can perpetually intersect and shape one another over the course of a lifetime. The lives of both Jean and Michelle epitomized this concept shaped and guided as they were by external political movements such as the U.S. counterculture; in turn we learn that they culled inspiration from other revolutions around the world and began to share that fervor with their radio listeners. It's an incisive chain reaction theory of history and political activism that has rarely been ushered in with the grace and delicacy on display here. A significant part of this film's power also arises from Demme's willingness to let us connect the lines between the pieces of information that he hands us. For instance: we may conclude that Jean and Michelle's respective backgrounds shaped them perfectly for one another (on emotional and spiritual levels) and laid the groundwork not only for a dynamic marriage but one guided by shared political conviction. But appropriately Demme never states this forthright and this is only one of dozens of examples. In a film abundant with overwhelming sequences two in particular stand out as indelible and feel intrinsically connected to one another. In the first we see the Tontons (Baby Doc Duvalier's police) marching in formation indistinguishable from one another emotionally mute mechanistic. The effect is chilling like watching an archival film of the Hitler Youth. And in another Demme splices together footage of the Haitian people thriving in the countryside - a sequence primal vibrant and raw. Observing the striking contrast between these scenes we suddenly begin to realize that the Haitian agricultural workers must struggle to retain an essence of humanity - a soul and spirit - that their vile leaders desperately want to quelch. By driving home insights such as these the documentary gradually begins to transcend the specific details of Dominique's life and death. Therefore when a key funeral scene arrives - thousands of saddened Haitian peasants gather in the Artibonite valley in the wake of Dominique's death many wearing sweatshirts with the broadcaster's likeness on them - we grasp the solidarity that unites them and the documentary suddenly seems to be less about Jean Dominique himself than the principles and language of revolution that he embodied. That scene - and the film as a whole - sing an anthem to universal resistance against all forms of political and social oppression regardless of racial or cultural backdrop. The depth and breadth of the conviction as it manifests onscreen would make its martyred subject unspeakably proud., , Patience (After Sebald) | Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train | The Tree That Remembers | Citizen King | Aristide and the Endless Revolution

When European settlers first arrived in Australia there was an almost immediate conflict between the recent arrivals and the nation's indigenous people whose rich cultural heritage which bore little resemblance to that of the Europeans. By the mid-19th century when white settlers had gained political control of the continent many aborigines found themselves removed from their lands and their children taken from them under the belief that the youngsters would be better off in a more "civilized" environment. Through most of the 20th century it was official government policy that half- or quarter-caste indigenous children were to be taken from their families and raised as "white" children in orphanages where they would be trained to work as domestic servants or laborers. In 1931 Molly (Everlyn Sampi) and her younger sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan) were three half-caste children from Western Australia who were taken from their parents under government edict and sent to an institution where they were subject to physical and emotional abuse as they were taught to forget their families their culture and their lives up to that point and re-invent themselves as members of "white" Australian society. Gracie and Daisy cling to Molly for support and Molly decides they need to return to their parents. Molly plans a daring escape and the three girls begin an epic journey back to Western Australia travelling 1500 miles on foot with no food or water and navigating by following the fence that has been build across the nation to stem an over-population of rabbits. A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) the government functionary in charge of relocating Western Australia's aborigines takes a special interest in the case of the three girls and brings in a veteran tracker Moodoo (David Gulpilil) to help find them secure in the belief he's acting in their best interest. Rabbit-Proof Fence was based on the acclaimed book by Doris Pilkington Garimara whose Aunt Daisy was one of the three children who made the extraordinary journey and helped her with the research for the book., , El Norte | I Am David | Edges of the Lord | Empire of the Sun | Australia | Son of Babylon

It's the first feature-length narrative film shot in a single take (on digital video using a specially designed disc instead of tape). Russian Ark is shot from the point-of-view of an unseen narrator as he explores the museum and travels through Russian history. The audience sees through his eyes as he witnesses Peter the Great (Maksim Sergeyev) abusing one of his generals; Catherine the Great (Maria Kuznetsova) desperately searching for a bathroom; and in the grand finale the sumptuous Great Royal Ball of 1913. The narrator is eventually joined by a sarcastic and eccentric 19th century French Marquis (Sergey Dreiden) who travels with him throughout the huge grounds encountering various historical figures and viewing the legendary artworks on display. While the narrator only interacts with the Marquis (he seems to be invisible to all the other inhabitants) the Marquis occasionally interacts with visitors and former residents of the museum.

Every spring the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee attracts students from all over the United States and filmmaker Jeff Blitz follows eight promising entrants as they journey to Washington D.C. in hopes of claiming the national championship and a 10000-dollar prize. Neil Kadakia from California has spent months training for the event with the help of his parents computer tutorials and professional coaches.

Nupur Lala is determined to go to the finals in the 1999 competition even though three boys from her Florida Junior High are determined to stop her. Ted Brigham grew up in a rural Missouri community where his intelligence has made him stick out like a sore thumb; both Ted and his teachers hope the National Spelling Bee will give him a chance to prove his gifts to his peers. Ashley White lives in a housing project in Washington D.C. and has risen to the spelling championships largely through the help of her teachers and her own determination. April DeGideo comes from a low-income family in Pennsylvania and is determined to use the Spelling Bee as a stepping stone to a better life. Emily Stagg comes from a wealthy Connecticut family and manages to squeeze her study for the Spelling Bee in between riding lessons and practicing with her choral group. And Harry Altman from New Jersey wavers between joy and agony as he makes his way through the competition.

She discovers that he has left a short message for her on the screen of his personal computer ("I love you. Be brave.") as well as the text of a novel he had recently completed. Changing the name on the title page to her own Morvern begins sending the manuscript out to publishers without having actually read it. Eventually Morvern disposes of her boyfriend's body scrubs away the evidence of his suicide and attempts to reintegrate herself with the world though the shocking events seems to have built a wall between her and those around her and she is unable to explain what has happened to anyone even her best friend Lanna (Kathleen McDermott).

When his plans went awry the young man Sandro do Nascimento armed with a pistol took the bus passengers hostage. Soon cops and reporters surrounded the bus. A SWAT team arrived. About four hours later the incident came to a horrific and tragic end. Filmmaker José Padilha's documentary Bus 174 explores the events of that day. The film uses a great deal of file footage of the event in addition to interviews with hostages policemen reporters and others connected to the incident and to the unstable and desperate young man at its center. The filmmakers explore social conditions in the city along with the personal traumas that led Sandro to his desperate act. As a child Sandro had witnessed the brutal murder of his mother and had subsequently found himself on the streets at an early age. In 1993 he survived the infamous massacre of homeless youths at Candelária which is widely thought to have been committed by police officers. Sandro was also imprisoned at a youth facility and in a city jail and the appalling conditions in those prisons are also depicted in the film.

Delia (Kyra Sedgwick) grew up in a fractured household; her mother abandoned the family when Delia was a child and her father (Brian Tarantina) was a drug-addled loser who could barely be prodded off the couch. When she entered adolescence Delia realized that she could use her body to get men to do as she pleased. While this gained her a feeling of power and self-sufficiency it also earned her a reputation as the "class slut" and the end product was her marriage to Kurt (David Warshofsky). Greta (Parker Posey) is the daughter of a successful lawyer (Ron Leibman) who left her mother when she was young and offered Greta criticism rather than affection. Plagued with self-doubt Greta is squandering her literary talents editing cookbooks and is married to Lee (Tim Guinee.

A year later Paula is uncertain in her feelings about Vincent unsettled to learn that she's pregnant and startled after witnessing a murder while out clubbing with a friend; she hits the road again and soon picks up a fellow alienated teen Kevin (Lou Taylor Pucci) who bears the scars of a recent -- and very brutal -- beating.

She saw Hitler in his everyday life right up until his final days and she witnessed firsthand the collapse of the Nazi regime. After the war Junge was "de-Nazified" by Allied forces as part of a program of amnesty for young people. She remained silent about her experiences for nearly 60 years until she agreed to be interviewed by artist Andre Heller whose own Jewish father escaped Austria as the Nazis came to power. Heller and documentarian Othmar Schmiderer edited ten hours of interview footage into the 90-minute film which uses no archival footage photos or background music. It's just Junge describing her experiences on camera and occasionally watching the video playback of herself as she describes those experiences. Junge denies any real knowledge or understanding of what the Nazis were doing while she worked for them. She discusses how she was taken in by Hitler who seemed fatherly and kind. She describes his personality. She goes into harrowing detail about the last days in the bunker. At times she seems overwhelmed by her sense of shame at her own ignorance and naïveté. Presumably unburdened after decades of guilt Junge passed away just hours after Blind Spot was shown at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival where it won the Panorama Audience Prize.

Although Adolf Hitler probably never gave Charlie Chaplin a second thought during his rise to power Chaplin was obsessed with the notion that there was a larger and more profound meaning to the coincidence of his age proximity to Hitler--not to mention the fact that both men became famous by sporting postage-stamp moustaches. In 1939 Chaplin inaugurated production of his first 100% all-talking picture in which he would abandon his familiar "Little Tramp" character in favor of two new screen alter-egos: A Jewish barber in the fictional European country of Tomania and the barber's exact lookalike the infamous dictator Adenoid Hynkel aka "Der Phooey." Utilizing rare color behind the scenes footage discovered by Chaplin's daughter Victoria and complemented with commentary from Charlie's coworkers contemporary filmmakers and movie historians this one-hour documentary detailed the making of The Great Dictator Chaplin's devastating (and often devastatingly funny) satire of the Nazis. Among the many topics covered in the film is Hollywood's frightened reaction to Chaplin's daring move (at a time when appeasing rather than openly opposing Hitler was the order of the day) and Hitler's own reaction upon seeing the completed film himself. Assembled by the brilliant historian and silent-movie preservationist Kevin Brownlow The Tramp and the Dictator represented a collaboration between Britain's Photoplay Productions and Germany's Spiegel TV. In America the film was first broadcast on October 1 2002 as the vanguard of a TCM cable network retrospective of Hitler-related films and cartoons beginning with the new digitally restored version of 1940's The Great Dictator., , Hey Hey We're the Monkees | The Agronomist | The Betrayal | Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple | Evita: The Story of Eva Peron | The Fight

However her family is unaware that Jess has a secret passion -- football (or soccer as it's known in North America). While Jess' enthusiasm for football star David Beckham is obvious given the fact his photos cover the walls of her room her parents don't know that in her spare time she likes to play a friendly game in the park with some of the boys in the neighborhood.

The movie opens at a refugee camp in Peshawar Pakistan where Afghans have sought refuge in the wake of the U.S. military campaign in their country following the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks. The story follows Jamal an orphaned teenager and Enayat his older companion as they make their way from Pakistan to London. Traveling in the back of trucks by bus and on foot the two cross Central Asia in an arduous journey punctuated by encounters with hostile border guards and shady smugglers. Even more traumatic is the ocean voyage from Turkey to Italy during which Jamal and Enayat are forced to hide in a shipping container with other asylum seekers including a terrified infant. Winterbottom shot the movie vérité-style on digital video and the smudgy look and quick cutting betray the movie's guerrilla roots. Enhancing its raw veneer is Winterbottom's reliance on improvised dialogue and non-actors.

Maziar Bahari's documentary And Along Came a Spider produced by HBO for the Cinemax Reel Life series tells the story of these murders.

Political filmmaker Costa-Gavras confronts this thorny issue in this film adapted from the stage drama The Representative and based in part on actual events. Kurt Gerstein (Ulrich Tukar) is a German chemist whose work on various government health projects led to him being added to the scientific staff of the Nazi SS. While working on disinfection and water purification programs to stem the tide of typhoid among German troops Gerstein creates a toxic cleanser called Zyclon B. Gerstein soon learns that the SS has found a different use for Zyclon B -- in gas form it is being used to exterminate Jews and other political undesirables en masse. Gerstein a man of strong Christian faith is horrified by this revelation and he is determined to tell the world in hope of stopping the genocide; however in Germany Sweden and the United States Gerstein's story falls on deaf ears. One man who does believe Gerstein is Riccardo Fontana (Mathieu Kassovitz) a Jesuit with ties to the Vatican and close contact with Pope Pius XII (Marcel Iures). Fontana urges the Pope to speak out against the ongoing massacre but the Pope declines believing Russia is a greater menace to the Catholic Church than the Nazis. In time desperate to spread the word of the holocaust Gerstein and Fontana find themselves joining ranks with Roman Jews being rounded up by Nazi forces in occupied Italy., , Wajda's Danton | In Darkness | Ordet | Holocaust | The Pianist | All the President's Men

Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson star respectively as Gavin Banek and Doyle Gibson two New York men whose lives become accidentally intertwined in a Good Friday fender bender on the FDR Drive. Late for a crucial appointment hotshot lawyer Gavin tosses Doyle a blank check and leaves the scene while Doyle whose car is inoperable is late for a court-appointed custody hearing. A recovering alcoholic Doyle's tardiness doesn't sit well with the judge who - sick of waiting for Gipson - grants custody to Doyle's ex-wife in Doyle's absence. The situation worsens when it becomes evident that Doyle has an equally important file belonging to Gavin which proves that an elderly man gave Banek's firm power-of-attorney over his foundation. So begins an escalating war of words and deeds between the two men. Soon egged on by an associate (Toni Collette) Gavin hires a "fixer" (Dylan Baker) to destroy Doyle's credit forcing Doyle to fire back with some cunning moves of his own.

Also a painter photographer and sculptor Snow's films focus on the mechanics of the camera and the formalistic possibilities of filmmaking. Like 2002's Waking Life *Corpus Callosum was shot on video with real-life actors and animated afterwards with Houdini software. Captured in slow zooms and 360-degree pans the images are continually messed with by various means from high-tech animation to presenting the video in reverse. Due to the digitized stretching and twisting the characters often switch clothing genders and ethnicity in graphic manipulations. Meanwhile the characters remain indifferent to the exploding images around them. Snow sets the characters in a generic office space where the environment is distorted by their actions. He also uses a living room setting where a family watches a blue sky on the TV while their media-oversaturated home fluctuates around them. The film also manipulates the basic filmmaking process by placing the credits in the middle.

It's 1991 and in the wake of the War in the Persian Gulf Saddam Hussein's forces are laying waste to villages in Iraq and Kurdistan believed to be harboring rebel forces who were attempting to bring down Hussein's regime with the encouragement but without the military support of the United States. In the midst of this chaos Mirza (Shahab Ebrahimi) an elderly Kurdish singer living in Iran becomes concerned about the safety of his ex-wife and former singing partner Hanareh (Iran Ghobadi) who over two decades earlier left him to marry another member of their ensemble and move to Kurdistan. Mirza rounds up his sons Barat (Faegh Mohamadi) and Audeh (Allah-Morad Rashtian) and together they set out to find Hanareh constantly bickering along the way. While Mirza and his sons witness firsthand the horrible devastation which has been visited upon Iraq by both U.S. bombs and Hussein's bloody reprisals they also find moments of beauty and humor along the way and come to better understand the strength of their people under unimaginable adversity.

His hobby became a vocation when he rejected the sacrifices necessary to become a professional musician. In the late 1920s he married Virginia Best and in 1930 opened a studio for commercial work. By 1935 Adams had received wide recognition for his photographs of Yosemite though some critics claimed his work lacked social vision.

Given up by his mother when her husband decided he didn't want him in the house Stevie was primarily raised by his step-grandmother and had already begun to reveal a stubborn and easily distracted personality when he met James. After he graduated from college James lost contact with Fielding but in 1995 after James had gone on to a career as a documentary filmmaker (and won acclaim for his film Hoop Dreams) he was reintroduced to Stevie only to learn that his life had taken a number of wrong turns. After a number of scrapes with the law and on-going battles with his family Fielding had been charged with molesting his eight-year-old cousin and he'd opted for a trial (which could lead to a twenty year prison sentence) rather than receive counseling due in part to his experiences in a mental hospital. James and his wife (who counsels sex offenders) wanted to offer Stevie whatever help they could and James opted to make a film about him hoping to discover where Stevie's life and gone wrong and how his tragic turn of fate could have been prevented. At the same time James (like many others in Stevie's life) began to wonder what they could have done and to what degree they let him down with James torn between his feelings for his friend and his need to portray all sides honestly. Featuring interviews with Fielding his family and his friends the documentary Stevie examines how society's safety net failed to catch one young man before it was too late.

Formed in late 1964 by five high-school buddies from suburban Detroit the MC5 -- vocalist Rob Tyner guitarists Fred "Sonic" Smith and Wayne Kramer bassist Michael Davis and drummer Dennis Thompson -- started out as a fairly typical Midwestern garage band but as the group embraced the passion of blues and R&B the sonic wanderlust of free jazz and psychedelia and the muscular power of hard rock it evolved into an uncommonly adventurous act who became the standard for other Detroit "high-energy" bands to follow. Managed by poet and political activist John Sinclair the MC5 also became the "house band" of the radical leftist group the White Panther Party and was a fixture at political rallies in the Midwest even after Sinclair was sentenced to ten years in prison for possession of marijuana. The band was a cause célèbre and a major draw in the Midwest scoring a contract with a major record label and becoming the only rock group to play at the protest rallies staged during the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention. But soon the bandmembers found themselves on the outs with both the straight-laced music industry and revolutionaries who questioned their political commitment; drug problems poor record sales and infighting began dogging the group and the MC5 soon faced a collapse whose humiliation outweighed the glory of their salad days. The band's legacy however never failed to impress music fans and its example proved massively influential with the punk rock movement that bloomed a few years after the group crashed and burned in 1972. MC5: A True Testimonial is a feature-length documentary on the group and its legacy featuring interviews with surviving members Kramer Davis and Thompson former manager Sinclair and many friends and family members as well as footage of the group in its prime (including FBI surveillance film of the 1968 Chicago Convention performance)., , Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten | The White Stripes: Candy Coloured Blues - Unauthorized | Lou Reed: Rock & Roll Heart | Louder Than Love: The Grande Ballroom Story | Monks: The Transatlantic Feedback | Blowing Fuses Left & Right: The Legendary Detroit Rock Interviews

Father Amaro (Gael Garcia Bernal) is a young Catholic priest whose mentor the Bishop (Ernesto Gomez Cruz) expects great things from him. However like all priests Amaro must first be assigned where he is needed most which leads him to the small rural community of Los Reyes where Amaro is to assist Father Benito (Sancho Gracia). To his shock Amaro discovers Benito is hardly following Holy Law -- he's having an affair with Sanjuanera (Angelica Aragon) a woman who runs a local restaurant and he's been helping a drug dealer launder his profits in exchange for large donations to the church which Benito feels is justified as the funds are being used to build a hospital and orphanage for the poor. Amaro is disgusted with Benito's actions but he soon discovers his own weaknesses when he falls in love with Amelia (Ana Claudia Talancon) Sanjuanera's teenage daughter. As Amelia finds herself falling for Amaro she breaks off her relationship with Ruben (Andres Montiel) a reporter. Ruben responds by publishing a story which reveals the details of Benito's dealings with the drug dealers; Benito in turn tries to lay the blame at the feet of noble Father Natalio (Damian Alcazar) whose work with local peasants has been wrongly interpreted as supporting armed revolutionary factions. As Amaro tries desperately to distance himself from the growing scandal he receives shocking news from Amelia when he learns she's pregnant with his child. The Crime of Father Amaro's portrayal of corruption within the Catholic Church led to an outcry from Catholic organizations both in Mexico and the United States where they attempted to organize a boycott of the film. However the tactic failed in Mexico where the controversy helped to boost ticket sales making it the highest-grossing Mexican film ever in its native country., , La Virgen de la lujuria | Bad Education | La Fièvre Monte à El Pao | Morte Di un Matematico Napoletano | The Barefoot Contessa | On Golden Pond

When an Aboriginal tracker (David Gulpilil) leads the manhunt for a fugitive native a series of atrocities are performed on the ancient tribe by a sadistic policeman participating in the search party. The line between savage and civilian is blurred beyond recognition when Fanatic (Gary Sweet) the policeman massacres a large group of peaceful Aboriginals. It eventually becomes clear that the tracker who purposely keeps the Aboriginal a half-day ahead of the search party is in control of the operation and has his own mysterious agenda. DeHeer takes a unique approach in the direction of this film; opting to show graphic paintings by artist Peter Coad during violent moments in lieu of filming bloody scenes among the actors.

While Max can no longer create his eye for talent is as keen as ever so he has become a successful art dealer specializing in Modernists such as George Grosz.

One day Max meets Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor) an emotionally intense fellow war veteran who has found himself penniless in Munich.

While Adolf takes Max's advice to heart and strikes up a friendship with him Max's friends find Adolf's open advocation of anti-Semitism rather troubling; Max who is Jewish simply chalks Adolf's attitudes up to unpleasant wartime experiences. But as Adolf immerses himself more deeply into his political interests and his thoughts on social engineering he begins to leave painting behind in favor of a more interesting art form the political arena.

In collaboration with Tony Grisoni Gilliam had written a script called The Man Who Killed Don Quixote in which a 20th century advertising man accidentally travels back in time and is mistaken by Don Quixote for his faithful companion Sancho Panza. After ten years of shopping the project to American studios with no success Gilliam and his producers had secured financing for the film from a consortium of European sources and Johnny Depp had been cast as the time-tripping adman with the venerable French actor Jean Rochefort as Don Quixote. However as the production moved closer to its start date more and more things began to go wrong -- contracts went unsigned key cast and crew members had not yet arrived and the carefully prepared budget seemed stressed to the breaking point. Nevertheless Gilliam soldiered on but after a mere six days of shooting during which Spanish Air Force jets ruined several takes flash floods destroyed several sets and Gilliam struggled to keep his dream afloat Rochefort suffered a severe back injury. The film's financiers decided to cash in their chips and pulled the plug in order to cash in on their insurance though Gilliam struggled for months afterward to find a way to put the production back on track. Documentary filmmakers Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe had been invited by Gilliam to make a film about the production of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote and after shooting 80 hours of footage of the chaotic pre-production process as well as the aborted shooting schedule they instead created Lost In La Mancha a look at the "un-making" of the film which along with the story of the project's brief rise and messy collapse featured a look at several completed scenes from the film as well as animated versions of the film's storyboards which offered a glimpse of the look and scale of the film Gilliam was attempting to create., , Tigrero: A Film That Was Never Made | Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse | Despite the Gods | Mia Madre | Tricked

Plantation Island is a community on the coast of Florida; the island was once a notorious hotbed of segregationists with most of the African-American population centered in the neighborhood of Lincoln Beach while Delrona Beach is primarily home to white residents. Marly Temple (Edie Falco) is the sixth generation of her family to live in Delrona Beach where she helps run a motel and cafe owned by her elderly and ill-tempered father (Ralph Waite) and drama instructor mother (Jane Alexander). Marly's former husband Steve (Richard Edson) is a scruffy ne'er do well who's a sucker for get-rich-quick scams while her current boyfriend Scotty (Marc Blucas) is struggling to make something of himself as a golf pro. Meanwhile Desiree Perry (Angela Bassett) is an actress who is returning to Lincoln Beach for the first time since she was a teenager hoping to introduce her new husband Reggie (James McDaniel) to her mother Eunice Stokes (Mary Alice). Desiree was the center of a minor local scandal when she became pregnant as a teenager and moved away. Eunice has never quite forgiven her while Flash (Tom Wright) Desiree's high school boyfriend and the man responsible hasn't seen her since. Eunice is looking after Terrell (Alex Lewis) a troubled youth recently found guilty of arson and Desiree and Reggie soon find themselves bonding with the misguided youth. In time Delrona Beach and Lincoln Beach are brought together by a common concern; Greg (Perry Lang) and Lester (Miguel Ferrer) are representatives from a nearby resort community looking to expand with Plantation Island looking like their most likely target. As homeowners debate whether to sell or stay put local government officials and the town's business community argue the merits and faults of the resort's expansion into Plantation Island.

Nicholas Nickleby (Charlie Hunnam) is a 19-year-old who becomes the head of the family when his father dies unexpectedly. Keeping watch over his mother (Stella Gonet) and his sister Kate (Romola Garai) becomes an even greater challenge when Nicholas discovers that his father lost the family fortune due to ill-advised investments. Without a shilling to his name Nicholas turns to his wealthy but unforgiving Uncle Ralph (Christopher Plummer) for help; Uncle Ralph offers to find work for all three and Nicholas becomes a teacher at a school for unfortunate boys run by Wackford Squeers (Jim Broadbent) and his wife (Juliet Stevenson). Squeers and his wife are cruel and frequently violent toward their charges and when Wackford without cause beats a weak and timid student Smike (Jamie Bell) Nicholas decides he can take no more and runs away with Smike in tow. The two young men fall in with a traveling theater troupe run by the genially eccentric Vincent Crummles (Nathan Lane) and his equally flamboyant spouse (Barry Humphries aka Dame Edna Everage). In time Nicholas returns to London to check in on his sister and mother. To his horror he learns that Uncle Ralph has promised Kate's hand to Sir Mulberry Hawk (Edward Fox) a wealthy older man with a less-than-wholesome interest in young women. Both Kate and Nicholas are upset at the prospect of this union and Nicholas attempts to tear his family away from Uncle Ralph's control beginning with a job working for the warm-hearted Charles Cheeryble (Timothy Spall) and his brother (Gerard Horan). Nicholas also falls in love with the fair Madeline (Anne Hathaway) but when Uncle Ralph learns of Nicholas' plot to foil Kate's impending marriage he strikes back by kidnapping Smike and attempting to force Madeline to wed Sir Hawk.

When his team makes it to the championship and wins for the first time in the school's history Jim is forced to live up to his end of the bargain.

On the sheer weight of his dynamic personality Shackleton was able to mount an exploratory journey to the Antarctic accompanied by a crew of 27 men among them celebrated Australian photographer Frank Day. Alas Shackleton's ship was crushed by packing ice early in the expedition forcing the crew to brave the merciless polar elements for a full ten months. Making matters worse public concern over Shackleton's plight was shunted aside when Great Britain entered WWI. First telecast in England on January 2 and 3 2002 the two-part TV biopic Shackleton stars Kenneth Branagh in the title role. The script does not shirk away from the subject's less savory character traits including his disastrous financial dealings and his blatant unfaithfulness to wife Emily (Phoebe Nicholls). Nonetheless one emerges from the film with a renewed respect and admiration for the visionary Shackleton and his bedraggled companions. Much of the imagery in Shackleton was based upon the still-surviving films made on the scene by Frank Day adding extra authenticity to the drama even though the film was made in Greenland and Iceland rather than the Antarctic. The two-part film made its American TV debut courtesy of the A&E cable network on April 7 and 8 2002; shortly afterward Shackleton was released on DVD with four additional hours of documentary footage., , NOVA: Shackleton's Voyage of Endurance | The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition | Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure | Shackleton's Boat Journey: The Story of James Caird | Shackleton: Escape from Antarctica | Great Adventurers: Ernest Shackleton - To the End of the Earth

When Susan Wilson (Angie Harmon) and her family move back to her Louisiana hometown and into their dream house they're a little overwhelmed by their eager-to-please neighbor Steve Glover (Jamey Sheridan). Doing odd jobs inviting them to use his hot tub and initiating them into the social life of his Protestant church Steve seems like the ideal friend. But when he starts offering unsolicited parenting advice showing up in the Wilson's house when they're out of town and exhibiting inexplicable knowledge of the family's secrets Susan and her husband Gary (Dale Midkiff) become concerned. Susan sneaks into the Wilson house and to her horror discovers videotapes of herself in the shower on the toilet and making love to her husband. Steve it seems is an electronic peeping Tom who installed cameras in the Wilson attic to provide himself with cheap visual thrills. After turning Steve in to the police Susan is horrified to discover that what he did was not a crime and that he can be prosecuted only for unauthorized entry. Even worse the elders of her church seem more interested in sweeping the issue under the rug than in providing comfort to Wilson her husband and her kids -- even after it's revealed that Steve took nude videotapes of various members of the congregation in the changing room next to his hot tub. Although she's so upset about the violation of privacy and the lack of support that she can't sleep anywhere but in her darkened closet Susan eventually overcomes her depression and wages a campaign to make video voyeurism a crime. Based on a true story Video Voyeur premiered on the Lifetime cable network in January 2002.

When Daria Tom and Tom's mother head off for a campus visit things don't go as planned. Daria almost bombs her interview; even worse traffic bad weather and the need for Tom to suck up to the alumni keep Daria from getting more than a drive-by look at her second-choice school Raft.

Caro's massive biography of President Lyndon Baines Johnson the made-for-cable Path to War retraces the world-shaking events occurring between LBJ's jubilant inaugural in 1965 and his tired dispirited decision not to seek another presidential term in 1968. At the crux of these tumultuous three years is the war in Vietnam which forces Johnson (here played by Michael Gambon) to shunt his proposed "Great Society" to the back burner. Though famous in political circles as a wrangler and compromiser LBJ cannot seem to do anything right in pursuing the war; nor are his chief advisors the hawkish Robert McNamara (Alec Baldwin) and the dove-ish Clark Clifford (Donald Sutherland) able to forge a permanent policy agreement. As Clifford warns Johnson that "escalation will ruin you and all the great good you want to do" McNamara presses for a continuation of the war lest America lose face and Vietnam fall to the Communists. The story unfolds with the inexorability of a Shakespearean tragedy with Johnson as a modern-day Macbeth Richard III and King Lear rolled into one. Of interest to non-history buffs is the appearance of two original cast members of the 1969 film M*A*S*H: Donald Sutherland as Clark Clifford and Tom Skerritt as William Westmoreland.

Rather it grew out of poem penned by a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx Abel Meeropol. Outraged by the shabby and often brutal treatment of black citizens in the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave Meeropol gravitated to the burgeoning civil rights movement of the 1930s where he also found a nurturing home for his left-of-center sentiments (the same sentiments which years later moved him to adopt the children of executed atomic spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg). To avoid persecution from the radical right and from the anti-Semites of the era Meeropol published the song under the pseudonym Lewis Allen the same name he later used for his less impassioned but equally powerful anti-bigotry ballad "The House I Live In." Naturally this 60-minute documentary includes film clips of Billie Holiday performing the title song (in her only TV appearance in 1958) as well as renditions by such activist-artists as Pete Seeger Josh White and Cassandra Wilson.

Bush's bid for the presidency was gaining momentum free-lance writer J.H. Hatfield contracted with St. Martin's Press to write a biography of the Texas governor and son of former U.S. President George Bush. When St. Martin's published Hatfield's book entitled Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of an American President it gained overnight media attention for its allegation (supported by unnamed sources later revealed to be insiders in the Bush campaign) that Bush was arrested for cocaine possession in 1972 but the Bush family exerted political pressure to have the incident wiped from the records. Alarmed by the controversy the book had generated as well as revelations about Hatfield's past which cast suspicions on his credibility (including the fact he was a convicted felon) St. Martin's buckled under pressure (some allegedly exerted by the Bush family and their legal team) and recalled the book. After Fortunate Son disappeared from shelves Sander Hicks a young political activist and punk rock singer approached Hatfield with a proposal to reissue the book through his small leftist publishing company Soft Skull Press. Horns and Halos is a documentary which examines the controversy over the book but places its main focus on two major players in this story -- Hicks whose energetic idealism doesn't always mask his naïveté or his endless self-promotion and Hatfield a kind but troubled man whose ambition and desire for literary success coupled with a desire to tell an important but controversial story proves to be his undoing.

In their 2002 biographical documentary Georgie Girl co-directors Peter Wells and Annie Goldson highlight the popular Member of Parliament's rapid rise through local government to prominence in the New Zealand national government. Born George Bertrand and of Maori descent Beyer's life began modestly as her farming family struggled against constant financial hurdles and racism. Escaping her rural beginnings and dealing with her gender identity issues with transsexual surgery Beyer became a star performer in the gay nightclubs of Auckland and Wellington before a descent into drug addiction and prostitution sent her into a rehabilitation facility in the town of Carterton. Almost instantly Beyer forged a strong attachment to her new community which led to her involvement and subsequent success in local and ultimately national politics.

Kitamura wrote and directed the samurai film Aragami while Tsutsumi created the urban warfare story 2LDK. The title is an abbreviation as one might see in a Japanese classified ad for a two-bedroom apartment with a living room a dining room and a kitchen. In 2LDK Nozomi (Eiko Koiki) is a quiet compulsively neat country girl who has recently moved to Tokyo in hopes of beginning a film career. Her roommate Lana (Maho Nonami) is also an actress but she's been at it for a while. She's brash about using her sexuality to get what she wants while Nozomi is repressed. The personal space issues that afflict every roommate situation are exacerbated by their wildly different temperaments. While Lana is racked with guilt over a past indiscretion that ended in tragedy Nozomi is used to being a big fish in a small pond and has trouble dealing with the pressures of big-city life. When they learn that they're up for the same part in a big film production the tension mounts. Lana pushes Nozomi's buttons by implying that she's been intimate with a mutual acquaintance she knows is courting Nozomi. Nozomi who diligently marks nearly every item in the apartment with the first initial of its proper owner lashes out when she discovers that Lana has used her shampoo and things gradually escalate from there into an all-out kill-or-be-killed war., , Apartment Zero | Mean Girls | Aragami: The Raging God of Battle | Misery | Wait Until Dark | Deadbolt

From his days in a Milwaukee chocolate factory to nights spent haunting the streets in search of prey the viewer peers cautiously over the edge of an abyss so deep and so far-stretching that most minds will never fathom the truly monstrous nature of Dahmer's heretofore unprecedented crime spree. As he befriends and brings home yet another potential victim in the form of an outgoing young man named Rodney (Artel Kayaru) Dahmer is forced to confront his past as the two grow increasingly close over the course of the evening.

Winnie's parents (Victor Garber and Amy Irving) are loving but overprotective and Winnie longs for a life of greater freedom and adventure. One day while exploring the nearby woods Winnie gets lost but she has the good fortune to happen upon the Tuck Family who live nearby - mother Mae (Sissy Spacek) father Angus (William Hurt) and sons Jesse (Jonathan Jackson) and Miles (Scott Bairstow). The Tucks are warm and caring people and Winnie feels right at home with them; she also finds herself developing a serious crush on Jesse and isn't so sure she wants to return; meanwhile her parents become increasingly distraught as they search for their missing daughter. But in time Winnie discovers there's a secret behind the seemingly idyllic lives of the Tuck Family; they have discovered a magical spring on their property and anyone who drinks from it will never grow old and never die. While to Winnie this sounds like a wonderful prospect the Tucks have come to understand this is as much of a curse as a blessing especially when she realizes Jesse is considerably older than she is. The Tucks also have to contend with the presence of the sinister Man In The Yellow Suit (Ben Kingsley) who wishes to buy their property and make a fortune from their "fountain of youth."

This racially volatile situation is first placed in the hands of renowned attorney George Cording (Derek Jacobi) who is defending young Duvinder Singh (Sonnell Dadral) and relentless crown prosecutor Gerald Lewis (Antony Sher) better known as "The Bastard of the Bailey." But as mentioned the focus is on the jurors as diverse a group as one is ever likely to meet. Among the selected dozen are Rose (Helen McCrory) an unhappily married beautician; Johnnie (Gerard Butler) a recovering alcoholic; Marcia (Nina Sosanya) a single mother who tends to allow herself to be intimidated into making snap judgments; Peter (Michael Maloney) a brusque self-made businessman; Charles (Stuart Bunce) a Catholic seminarian uncertain of his calling; Elsie (Sylvia Syms) a lonely old widow; and Jeremy (Nicholas Farrell) a chronic gambler. How will the jurors' personalities affect the outcome of the case -- or for that matter the dissemination of facts?

Making his professional debut in 1907 the Russian-born dancer first became the sensation of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Ballet and then spread his fame worldwide when he became a dancer and choreographer with the Ballets Russes in Paris working alongside the noted dance patron Sergei Diaghilev. Nijinsky's fame came not just from his technical skills as a dancer but his bold and unrelenting desire to expand the boundaries of what could be expressed through the medium of ballet. However while he blazed many trails he was also a man driven by a mixture of anger paranoia and visions of his own greatness. His beliefs struck many as perilously close to madness and in 1919 a few months after his final performance Nijinsky was committed to a mental institution where he would remain until his death in 1950. He kept a diary in which he wrote about his life and accomplishments as well as his philosophies his personal demons and his feelings about his own creative nature. Bowdlerized excerpts were first published in 1936 while the unexpurgated text finally saw the light of day in 1995. Filmmaker Paul Cox has long been fascinated by Nijinsky's writings and his feature Nijinsky: From the Diaries of Vaslaw Nijinsky is a labor of love in which Derek Jacobi reads from the dancer's journals while a variety of images -- some abstract some re-creations of Nijinsky's dances still others dramatizations of episodes from his life -- appear onscreen to compliment or contrast the words he wrote to explain and express himself., , Wittgenstein | Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould | From the Journals of Jean Seberg | Vincent: The Life & Death of Vincent Van Gogh | Nico-Icon | Nijinsky

Writer and director Karim Ainouz brings dos Santos' story to the screen in this vibrant drama seasoned with music and dance. A tall and physically imposing man dos Santos (played by Lázaro Ramos) grew up poor on the streets of Brazil; and once he reached adulthood he shared a home in one of Rio de Janeiro's less picturesque neighborhoods with a handful of friends including Laurita (Marcelia Cartaxo) a streetwalker; her baby daughter; Taboo (Flavio Bauraqui) a nightclub performer who sometimes turned tricks for extra cash; and Renatinho (Felippe Marques) one of dos Santos' lovers. After landing a job at a nightspot called The Blue Danube dos Santos grew fascinated with the elaborate costumes and choreography of the stage shows and became a singer and dancer at the club. However when the management declined to pay him dos Santos took matters into his own hands and demanded his salary at knifepoint leading to the first of many stays behind bars. Upon his release dos Santos pledged to make his name as a cross-dressing entertainer though his fiery temper made taking advantage of him a bad idea.

However a particularly grisly killer is on the loose and Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) Graham's one-time mentor at the Bureau asks him to return to duty to find him. The "Tooth Fairy" is a vicious murderer who kills entire families at once covering the eyes of his victims with bits of a shattered mirror. Graham finds he needs help putting together the pieces of the "Tooth Fairy" case and he calls upon Lecter looking for advice. Lecter at once vaguely helpful and self-serving as usual offers scraps of information to Graham which help him zero in on the killer. But Lecter knows more than he's telling; the "Tooth Fairy" is actually Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes) a troubled and withdrawn man who admires Lecter's violent panache and corresponds with him. Dolarhyde works at a film processing lab where one of his co-workers a blind woman named Reba McClane (Emily Watson) seems to be quite attracted to him. As Dolarhyde wrestles with both his murderous impulses and his feelings for McClane Lecter plays Graham and Dolarhyde against one another so that as the FBI agent comes closer to catching "the Tooth Fairy" Dolarhyde moves in on his next victim -- Graham's family.

Encompassing a dizzying number of themes this elaborately stylized experimental film showcases Barney's affinity for architecture and sex. Much of the highly symbolic imagery involves Celtic mythology and phallic references with Barney himself appearing as the Entered Apprentice and sculptor Richard Serra playing architect Hiram Abiff. Some of the settings include the Chrysler Building in New York City the Saratoga race track and the Guggenheim museum ( where much of Barney's work is actually shown). Spatially driven rather than narratively the film is a display of visual effects and impulses with little to no dialogue.

It all begins in 1920 when the then-Duke of York Albert (James Wilby) known affectionately as Bertie meets and falls in love with the aristocratic 19-year-old Elizabeth Bowes-Lytton (Juliet Aubrey). Although their marriage makes international headlines the mild unprepossessing Bertie knows that he will always play second fiddle to his dashing older brother the Prince of Wales in the hearts and minds of the British people. This is never more true than when Bertie's brother ascends to the throne as King Edward VIII in 1936. That same year however the new King abdicates so that he may marry the woman of his choice thereby thrusting the reluctant Bertie into the limelight as Monarch of the British Isles. Spurred on by the love and devotion of his lifelong helpmate Elizabeth Bertie -- now King George -- proves more than worthy of his new burdens and responsibilities especially during the darkest days of WWII. Although the King passes on in 1952 (a death hastened by his fondness for tobacco) Elizabeth lives well past the century mark beloved by her subjects as the mother of the future Queen Elizabeth II and the impulsive Princess Margaret.

Consumed by grief after the hit-and-run death of her 18-year-old son Peter (Nick Roth) Beverly Lowry (played by Diane Keaton who also executive-produced the film) is unable to overcome her depression despite the tender ministrations of her supportive husband Ethan (Maury Chaykin). But when a psychic informs her that her son's death was caused by a woman Beverly obsessively begins researching the lives of other women who'd taken lives. The trail of information leads her to the infamous Karla Faye Tucker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) slated to become the first white woman executed for murder in Texas in 135 years. Although the film necessarily telescopes the facts (the actual relationship between Lowry and Tucker spanned nearly a decade) the film successfully details how Beverly's friendship with the doomed Karla enabled both women to expunge the demons within their respective souls.

Later Ishimatsu is thrown in jail for killing a loan welsher where he becomes friends with Imamura (Ryosuke Miki) a lieutenant in a rival gang. When Ishimatsu finally gets out of stir both Sawada and Chieko are waiting for him. He quickly rises the ranks of the gang power structure only for him to blow it over a misunderstanding over a ten-million-yen loan.

The film depicts Hanssen (played by William Hurt) as hyper-intelligent and hyper-sensitive frustrated by what he perceives to be the mediocrity of his fellow federal agents (at one point in the story Hanssen's boss advises him to "dumb down" if he hopes to survive in the agency). Hanssen's self-imposed lofty standards and values are somewhat at odds with his rather kinky sexual preferences and with his habit of spending far more than he earns. In danger of losing everything he owns due to improvident financial transactions Hanssen proves to be ripe for plucking by the Soviet KGB which offers him wealth beyond his wildest dreams if he will simply transfer top secret information to the Russians. Throughout his career of duplicity and treachery Hanssen enjoys the unswerving loyalty of his wife Bonnie (Mary-Louise Parker) who remains blissfully ignorant of his double-agent activities until the day of his arrest.

Byatt's Booker Prize-winning 1990 novel Aaron Eckhart (who has starred in all of LaBute's films) plays Roland Michell an American academic researcher working in London who discovers some important letters written by a famous Victorian poet Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam [Gosford Park]). Ash was presumed to have been totally devoted to his wife but Roland finds letters written to another unnamed woman and soon determines that the intended recipient was another less well-known poet Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle of Sunshine). Roland contacts Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) an expert on LaMotte's life and work who tells him that LaMotte couldn't have had an affair with Ash because she lived most of her life with a female companion Blanche Glover (Lena Headey) in what was apparently a romantic relationship. Despite Maud's skepticism the two begin to investigate and uncover a wealth of information about the affair between the two poets. Period scenes of the illicit relationship between Ash and LaMotte are intercut with the contemporary investigation of the two academics. Roland and Maud initially fight their attraction to each other but as the pair find more evidence of the historical and tragic romance they find themselves overcoming their own resistance to romantic entanglement. Possession was kicked around as a film project for a long time before LaBute became interested. Director Sydney Pollack originally was slated to film a screenplay by David Henry Hwang (M. Butterfly) who receives a credit on the finished film. When LaBute took over the project years later he reworked the screenplay with Laura Jones (The Portrait of a Lady)., , The French Lieutenant's Woman | Bel Ami | 84 Charing Cross Road | Oscar and Lucinda | The Heritage: An Eternity of Love | Waterland

The one guideline they were given was that no one film could exceed 11 minutes nine seconds and one frame. The resulting omnibus film 11'09"01 showed at festivals around the world the following year and garnered a theatrical release in 2003. Each filmmaker's entry takes a different approach: French director Claude Lelouch tells the tale of a World Trade Center tour guide who is on the verge of a breakup with his deaf girlfriend when the terrorist attacks hit; similarly Hollywood actor-director Sean Penn chronicles the lonely existence of an old man living not far from the Twin Towers. Egyptian director Youssef Chahine and British social realist filmmaker Ken Loach created the most controversy with their entries which respectively address the points-of-view of a suicide bomber and of a Chilean who recalls the brutal coup funded by the United States in his country on September 11 1973. Alejandro González Iñárritu's piece is the most abstract taking images from television on the day of the attacks and cutting them with selected bursts of sound.

Instead we have allowed technology to become the "nature" in which we live and as it stretches our physical and emotional environment in new and troubling directions we have created for ourselves a world of greater chaos violence and confusion.

Sharing a fondness for off-center pop music and absurdist humor the pair decided to form a band and later moved to Brooklyn NY in search of their big break. Adopting a rather unusual two-man lineup (guitar and accordion accompanied by a drum machine) the duo began performing as They Might Be Giants and their shows were part concert part performance art and part edgy comedy. Slowly but surely They Might Be Giants became one of the biggest bands on the alternative rock scene and while they never threatened to break into the upper reaches of the Billboard charts they've managed to develop a loyal cult following and after nearly 20 years together are still recording and performing their one-of-a-kind songs on their own terms. Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns) is a documentary which looks at the long and sometimes strange history of They Might Be Giants featuring extensive interviews with Flansburgh and Linnell; thoughts from fellow musicians Frank Black and Syd Straw; endorsements from noted authors Dave Eggers Gina Arnold and Michael Azerrad; and readings of the group's lyrics from actors (and fans) Harry Shearer Janeane Garofalo Michael McKean and Annette O'Toole., , The Fearless Freaks: The Wondrously Improbable Story of the Flaming Lips | Songs for Cassavetes | I Am Trying To Break Your Heart | Paul Westerberg: Come Feel Me Tremble | Athens Georgia: Inside/Out | The Filth and the Fury

And can he find happiness with Sharona while Lexi is still in the picture?

The story is told in flashback from Exner's point of view. In voice-overs Exner breaks her life down into three critical mistakes -- the three major romantic relationships in her life. The first she explains was marrying Billy Campbell (Grant Nickalls) who was more concerned with his acting career than with their marriage and who cheated on her frequently. Her friendship with an L.A.-based mobster leads to an affair with Sinatra which she breaks off after he tries to involve her in a ménage a trios. She remains friends with Sinatra and then meets Kennedy while he's just beginning his primary campaign for the presidency and she soon falls in love with him. At around the same time she meets Chicago gangster Sam Giancana (Peter Friedman) who falls in love with her and is jealous of her romance with Kennedy. Eventually she becomes a liaison between the presidential candidate and the mob carrying briefcases of Kennedy money to Giancana for his help with the election. Kennedy professes his love for her and tells her that his marriage is just for show and that he'll get a divorce if he doesn't win the presidency. Of course things don't work out the way Exner might have hoped. The FBI begins harassing her and she grows frustrated with her arrangement with the president.

Harrison Ford stars as Captain Alexi Vostrikov a Russian naval officer who's being given command of the Soviet Union's first nuclear submarine K-19 at the height of the Cold War in 1961. The vessel's previous commander Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) has been demoted to executive officer following a botched test and his outspoken assertions that the flagship is not yet ready for deployment but he curbs his resentment and resolves to serve his new superior well. Polenin's concerns are well founded: parts are not yet installed equipment is missing and the ship's doctor is killed in an auto mishap. Political pressure forces Vostrikov to sail his crew into the North Atlantic anyway for a missile fire test that serves as a warning to the U.S. that its enemy is now its technological equal. The test is a success but a disastrous leak in the K-19's reactor cooling system soon threatens to create enough heat to detonate the craft's nuclear payload -- which would certainly be mistaken for the first salvo in a worldwide atomic exchange and spark the beginning of World War III. With no other option Vostrikov orders his men to repair the damage in ten-minute shifts irradiating them hopelessly. The conflict between the seemingly bureaucratic Communist Vostrikov and the more humane Polenin escalates until a surprising twist reveals where both officers' loyalties truly lie., , Phantom | Das Boot | Crimson Tide | The Hunt for Red October | Ice Station Zebra | The Peacemaker

However with Europe no longer safe and passage to Great Britain or the United States frequently unavailable many were forced to seek out other destinations; one unexpected haven turned out to be Shanghai which was willing to take in the refugees. However with the Chinese city under Japanese occupation following the Sino-Japanese war Jews were forced into a squalid tumbledown ghetto known as Hong Kew and treated with little respect by the ruling forces. But despite the fact the Japanese went out of their way to make life difficult for the refugees the people of Shanghai themselves familiar with violent treatment by outside political forces for the most part embraced the new settlers and many of the refugees regarded the people of Shanghai with tremendous gratitude.

LeGuin. Former child star Lukas Haas is effectively cast as George Orr an otherwise ordinary man who experiences extraordinary dreams. When the visions in his head begin coming true -- and even seem to be altering reality -- the anguished Orr consults psychiatrist Walter Haber (James Caan) which is the first of many miscalculations on the part of the protagonist. Dr. Haber intends to harness George's "talent" to bring his own peculiar notion of Utopia to full fruition. Will the fabric of the space-time continuum unravel as Haber plots and plans and Orr's dreams become more and more frightening? And how does Orr's extremely skeptical (and ravishingly beautiful) lawyer Heather LaLache (Lisa Bonet) figure into all this?

Viacom, Showtime, Food for Thought, High School Life | Out For Revenge, teenagers high-school outcast assault death-threat group football-team, , Inspired by a play that has been presented dozens of times to middle- and high-school students throughout the United States Bang Bang You're Dead ponders the possible reasons that outwardly "normal" teenagers periodically resort to Columbine-style violence. The focus here is on Trevor Adams (Ben Foster) an intelligent but hypersensitive high schooler whose troubled past has designated him "at risk." Feeling persecuted by those stronger and more popular than himself Trevor has already run afoul of classmates and teachers alike by making death threats against the school football team. Now he has aligned himself with a group of fellow "outsiders" who call themselves the Trogs. Indulging in prankery that runs the gamut from merely irritating to potentially dangerous Trevor and the Trogs plan an all-out deadly assault against their so-called enemies. Although the script points out that peer pressure and bullying has gone beyond the point of harmlessness in today's society it is careful not to blame any one person or group for what ultimately happens to Trevor; even Trevor himself is shown to be comprised of equal parts villain and victim.

Any soldier that speaks Navajo is an immediate asset including Ben and his pal Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie). Joe's orders are to "baby sit" Ben during the invasion of Saipan protecting him if possible but -- if the code-talker's capture becomes imminent -- to kill him before he falls into enemy hands. Meanwhile Charlie is to be guarded by affable harmonica player Ox Henderson (Christian Slater). Joe reluctantly accepts this new duty as a way to get back into the war and in the ensuing carnage his nearly suicidal acts of bravery make him a hero while Ben becomes paralyzed by fear. Determined to live up to Joe's example Ben musters up his courage even in the face of racism from a fellow soldier (Noah Emmerich) and ends up rescuing his own protector behind enemy lines by briefly posing as a Japanese soldier. Despite their growing mutual respect Joe is eventually forced to take an action that threatens to shatter his bond with Ben as the war's tragic losses strike closer to home for both men.

Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate (1981) also employed elements of the Johnson County War in its story. Manfred's book and this film center on Cain Hammett (Tom Berenger) a lonesome cowboy who hankers for Rory (Michelle Forbes); she has married his younger brother Dale (Adam Storke) in spite of the fact that she really loves Cain.

Cain Hammett's real-life counterpart Nate Champion was a prime target of mercenaries hired by the big cattlemen and the siege of Cain's cabin which was the opening salvo in the war provides the film with its climax., , Streets of Laredo | Lonesome Dove | Heaven's Gate | Red River | How the West Was Won | Dances With Wolves

Puck (Devon Gummersall) is a college dropout and self-styled political radical who lives with a handful of friends in an anarchist commune near Plano TX. Puck's roommates and fellow semi-revolutionaries include aging hippie Johnny Red (John Savage) man-crazy feminist Karla (Gina Philips) DJ and ladies' man Sweeney (Johnny Whitworth) and cheerful mischief maker Double Dee (Steve Van Wormer). While Puck and his pals enjoy engaging in occasional acts of creative vandalism their sense of anarchy is more a matter of personal choice than a genuine threat against the larger standing order. That begins to change when the mysterious Johnny Black (Dylan Bruno) ingratiates himself into the commune. Johnny Black's political agenda is significantly more aggressive than that of Puck and his friends and his willingness to use violence to achieve his ends disturbs Puck as Black not only takes control of the group but adds guns explosives and sabotage to their formula. Puck also finds himself torn between his commitment to his ideals and his infatuation with Jody (Katherine Towne) whose sexual appetites run counter to her public reputation as a Christian and Young Republican organizer.

Japanese filmmaker Hiroshi Shinomiya made an earlier film Scavengers about Payatas and returned there several years later for another look. The production was slowed early on by a typhoon and shortly after filming started one of the two mountains of garbage that comprise the dump collapsed destroying makeshift homes and killing as many as 1000 residents. Shinomiya shows the hapless rescue workers pulling the dead from under all the mud and debris. Families mourning the loss of loved ones are also shown. As a result of the collapse the Philippine government halts garbage deliveries to the Payatas for safety reasons. This makes life even more difficult for those that remain as they make their living scavenging. The residents deal with their loss of income as well as they can and many protest to demand the restoration of the garbage dumping. Shinomiya focuses predominantly on three families each of which faces their own crises. One family has a little boy Alex with hydrocephalus which renders him an invalid. Another couple is expecting the birth of their second child and the father cannot find work. The third family is slightly better off as they have two small pigs and are also able to eat yams from a relative's plants. As their situation worsens the families desperately hope for change.

The Backyard is a documentary which presents an objective portrait of the bizarre world of backyard wrestling focusing on the folks in the ring (mostly teenagers) and how and why they literally make themselves bleed for audiences who often number less than a dozen. Some dream of stardom (with a few forming their own semi-pro leagues) while others simply thrive on the attention and adrenaline. The filmmakers also visit with the friends and families of the young grapplers some of who are genuinely supportive while others are visibly appalled at the antics in the makeshift rings. WWE star Rob Van Dam also makes a guest appearance. The Backyard had its world premier at the 2002 South by Southwest Film Festival and has since won prizes at the 2002 Edinburgh International Film Festival the 2003 Texas Film Festival and the 2003 Brooklyn Film Festival., , Beyond the Mat | Go Tigers! | The Best of Times | High School | All the King's Men | No End in Sight

Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) is a British journalist who in 1952 is covering the early stages of the war in Indo-China for the London Times not a demanding assignment since few in England are especially interested in the conflict. When not filing occasional reports Fowler spends his time with Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen) a beautiful woman who shares lovemaking and opium with Fowler and is willing to accept the fact the married journalist will never make her his wife. Fowler becomes friendly with Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) a cheerful and articulate if seemingly naïve American who is in Saigon as part of a medical mission. As Fowler and Pyle develop a closer friendship Pyle is introduced to Phuong and the American soon becomes infatuated with her. When Fowler's editors suggest he return to London he responds by digging himself deeper in covering the war and Pyle attempts to take Phuong away; she soon rejects him. Undaunted Pyle continues with his work but Fowler discovers that medical help is not what the American is bringing to Vietnam. Pyle is in fact a CIA operative who is helping to organize and finance a "Third Force" who will battle Ho Chi Min's forces as well as the French and their allies. Fowler also learns that Pyle is behind a series of bombings which are believed to have been carried out by Communist extremists and faces the ugly fact that his American friend is in fact a terrorist killing in the name of Uncle Sam's political interests. While completed in the fall of 2001 The Quiet American went unreleased until late 2002; after the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 the film's producers felt the film's critical view of America's role in the Vietnam war might be considered especially offensive., , The Quiet American | Clear and Present Danger | Frost/Nixon | Apocalypse Now | Indochine | Cirkus Columbia

Toula (Vardalos) is a Greek-American woman who is in her early thirties and single with no immediate prospects of changing that status any time soon. This bothers Toula a bit but not half as much as it distresses her mother (Lainie Kazan) and father (Michael Constantine) who want to send her to Greece in hopes of finding a husband in the old country. Toula isn't interested in leaving the country to find a man but since she works in the family business -- a Greek restaurant in Chicago called Dancing Zorba's -- she has to hear about it whether she likes it or not.

Despite her dad's misgivings Toula signs up for a night-school class studying computers trades in her glasses for contact lenses gets a different job at a travel agency and spruces herself up with a new look and a new attitude. To her very pleasant surprise she once again encounters the handsome stranger who soon asks her out on a date. Schoolteacher Ian Miller (John Corbett) is seemingly perfect -- he's tall handsome smart good-natured and soon in love with Toula -- except for two little things: he's not Greek and he's a vegetarian both of which horrify Toula's family. When Ian pops the question (and Toula says yes) the bride-to-be has to negotiate a reasonably peaceful meeting between Ian's upper-class parents and her own working-class extended family. There's also the matter of the wedding which Toula's mother is planning around the notion that quantity IS quality.

Undaunted Richardson attended Northwestern on a track scholarship and went on to get his Masters at Louisiana Tech. Fresh out of school Richardson needed a job so when he got an offer to teach in the Navajo community of Shiprock NM he took it. The documentary Rocks With Wings tells the story of how Richardson took charge of the losing girls' basketball team at Shiprock High School and within a few years turned them into state champions. The basketball team became a source of inspiration for the impoverished town. The film details through interviews and old footage the struggles Richardson went through with his young players. He came in with a hardnosed attitude and instilled discipline and while the players excelled on the court they were personally hurt by his constant criticism. An older white assistant coach Bill Dowty treated the girls more kindly but Richardson felt that Dowty was undermining his authority. The night before the state championship game in 1987 the situation came to a head. A team meeting was held and led by star player Cheryl Lee some of the players finally let Richardson know how much pain his style of coaching was causing them. Richardson didn't respond well at first and the next day the team lost a fierce battle against their powerhouse cross-town rivals Kirtland Central. The following year Richardson took a more sensitive approach and the team began to reach its potential.

The pageant was an immediate sensation and quickly became a lasting part of the American consciousness. It also became a subject of controversy on a number of different levels inciting criticism by feminists who believed the event projected an negative image of women and accusations of racism during the long period during which only white women were allowed to compete (it wouldn't be until 1983 that an African-American won the prize). Miss America is a documentary (produced for the PBS series The American Experience) which examines the history of the Miss America Pageant as well as its social impact and the view points of its supporters and detractors over the years; the film features an interesting sidebar on Bess Meyerson the first (and to date the only) Jewish Miss America whose victory in 1945 was considered potent ammunition against anti-Semitism so soon after the end of World War II and the revelation of the holocaust., , American Experience: The Pill | Heavy Petting | The Hidden Führer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality | The Beauty Academy of Kabul | Lipstick & Dynamite

Filmmakers John S. Friedman (producer of the acclaimed Marcel Ophüls documentary Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie) and Eric Nadler (a journalist who has worked on many installments of the PBS series P.O.V.) begin their story with the espionage trial of Karl-Heinz Schaab a German native charged with selling nuclear secrets to Iraq. Friedman and Nadler interview principals involved in the case and investigative journalists as they track Schaab from Germany to Brazil where he flees temporarily to escape prosecution. Eventually they link Schaab and his centrifuge technology to Degussa a German corporation. They then uncover Degussa's dark past as the company the SS contracted to process gold and silver from their victims' teeth. Degussa was also involved in developing the gas Zyklon-B used in the concentration camp gas chambers. Along the way they interview the last living member of the Nazi regime's nuclear weapons team. The story continues back in the present day as Schaab returns to face trial threatening to name names and expose higher-ups in the chain of command. That threat apparently accounted for the surprising results of his trial., , No End in Sight | Good Night and Good Luck. | Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Roméo Dallaire | Sir!

Based on the book by Bill Carter and Marc Gunther the film chronicles the creation of ABC Television's Monday Night Football telecast in 1970 then continues with the weekly telecast's rapid ascent to the top of the ratings. Reasoning that such a momentous undertaking needed a spectacular "star" lineup in the announcing booth ABC's aggressive sports director Roone Arledge (John Heard) teams the highly opinionated irritatingly erudite Cosell with not one but two charismatic ex-athletes "Dandy Don" Meredith (Brad Beyer) and Frank Gifford (Kevin Anderson). The film makes much of Cosell's open disdain towards his "intellectually inferior" co-anchors and of Meredith and Gifford's reaction to their booth-mate's jibes and also recreates many of Monday Night Football's highlights notably Cosell's announcement in the middle of an important game that John Lennon has just been murdered.

Dealing with class struggle aimlessness and intensely self-destructive substance abuse the film documents a year in the life of the director's brother Adam Koury and Adam's friend Josh Siegfried two working-class boys who loathe the college-bound rich kids of their small town and their own meandering existences with varying degrees of intensity. The story began to change after Siegfried's arrest and subsequent jail term so the film was expanded to 57 minutes for festivals and again to 65 minutes for its theatrical debut. When Siegfried returns from jail he is a far different person than the hilariously profane rebel presented in the first part of the film. Sporting a pink mohawk and punk clothing the newly sullen teen has turned all of his rage and resentment inward associating with a rough crowd and ratcheting up his consumption of painkillers and alcohol until he is either barely conscious or spewing vomit in parking lots. Adam changes too pulling away from Siegfried and starting the painful process of growing up. The third change that is presented in this remarkable film occurs to the director himself. Starting as a dispassionate observer Josh Koury is slowly brought into the story as he begins to understand his responsibility (notably following a stern dressing-down by his mother) as both an older brother and a role model. But if the transformations affecting the Koury brothers give Standing By Yourself its heart the story of Josh Siegfried gives it its dark disturbing soul. The film's final images of him -- strangely reminiscent of the final shots of River Phoenix in the similarly titled Stand By Me before the audience is told of his character's prison term and eventual death in a bar fight -- are what lifts this film from another Kids-type look at aimless youth into a powerful and painfully unforgettable experience., , Kids | Gummo | Billy the Kid | The Decline of Western Civilization | The Decline of Western Civilization 2: The Metal Years | The Decline of Western Civilization - Part III

By the time Carter entered the second year of his presidency his administration had already bogged down in legislative battles and economic difficulties. Carter nonetheless persevered signing the Panama Canal Treaty and arranging for a peace accord between Israel and Egypt at Camp David in 1978. These accomplishments however seemed to mean little once American hostages were taken at the U.S. Embassy in Iran at the end of 1979. The hostages would remain in captivity for 444 days and remain unreleased until Ronald Reagan became president in 1981. Carter returned to the public spotlight in 1984 when he began working with Habitat for Humanity. In 1986 groundwork began on the Carter Center a facility designed to arrange peaceful solutions to world conflicts. In 2002 Carter became the first president to visit Cuba in over 40 years and he also received the Nobel Peace Prize.

Saito notices an old photo of a samurai in the doctor's home and asks him about it. As it turns out the photo is of Yoshimura (Kiichi Nakai of Warriors of Heaven and Earth) and both men had a strong connection to him. Saito and Ono take turns reminiscing about their experiences and the film flashes back 30 years to the tumultuous beginnings of the Meiji era when the emperor bent on modernization consolidated his power and the shogunate with its samurai was phased out. Saito remembers Yoshimura as a fellow member of the Shinsegumi a samurai group divided between loyalty to its shogun and the defense of the emperor. Saito looked down on the money-grubbing shabbily dressed Yoshimura from the moment they met and even decided to kill him. But Yoshimura soon proved his prowess with the sword and his commitment to samurai ideals. Ono remembers Yoshimura as the disgraced father of his best friend. Yoshimura abandoned his village and his clan during a famine to join the Shinsegumi and as the story unfolds his motives come to light. Caught in the middle between conflicting forces their way of life rendered obsolete Saito loses contact with Yoshimura during a bloody battle and assumes he is dead.
