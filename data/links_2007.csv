There Will Be Blood is Anderson's loose adaptation of the novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair and it focuses its attentions on Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) a miner who happens upon black gold during a disastrous excavation that ends in a broken leg. Pulling himself up from the bowels of the earth both literally and metaphorically Plainview embarks on a systematic and steadfast approach to mastering the oil business. Using plain-spoken and straightforward language Plainview launches a campaign to convince small-town property owners they should let him drill their land. Without him they won't have the equipment to access the profit beneath their feet. He builds an empire this way -- and gradually becomes obsessed with the intrinsic value of power growing increasingly irascible and paranoid in the process. Plainview meets his match in Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) a teenage preacher in the small California town of Little Boston whose brother tipped Plainview off to the town's plentiful supply of untapped oil. To fully reap the benefits of the land Plainview must suffer the opposing whims of this "prophet" whose legitimacy is questionable at best. And it's unclear if either man is prepared to pay the humiliating price the other wants to exact. There Will Be Blood features an anachronistic soundtrack by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood and it was shot in the same town where the James Dean epic Giant was filmed., Daniel Day-Lewis | Paul Dano | Kevin J.

The Schnabel/Harwood picture follows Bauby's story to the letter -- his instantaneous descent from a wealthy and congenial playboy and the editor of French Elle to a bed-bound hospitalized stroke victim with an inactive brain stem that made it impossible for him to speak or move a muscle of his body. This prison as it were became a kind of "diving bell" for Bauby -- one with no means of escape. With the editor's mind unaffected his only solace lay in the "butterfly" of his seemingly depthless fantasies and memories. Because of Bauby's physical restriction he only possessed one channel for communication with the outside world: ocular activity. By moving his eyes and blinking he not only began to interact again with the world around him but -- astonishingly -- authored the said memoir via a code used to signify specific letters of the alphabet.

Hou begins with Lamorisse's central conceit -- that of a mysterious red balloon tracking a lonely young French boy around the city -- and broadens the story to weave an extended meditation on urban isolation and dysfunctional slightly broken Parisian lives. The red balloon here acts as a kind of observer to a little boy named Simon (Simon Iteanu) who lives with his harried mother Suzanne (Juliette Binoche) -- a voice actress in a puppet theater -- in a cramped flat in the City of Lights. Simon spends the majority of his time away from Suzanne accompanied by a Chinese film student Song (Song Fang) who baby-sits. From time to time Suzanne recognizes her neglect of young Simon and then overcompensates with sporadic bursts of affection and devotion. She remains far more concerned with the pressures of her daily life -- specifically the problems wrought by her downstairs tenant (Hippolyte Giardot) and by Simon's ere-estranged father -- than with the emotional state of her young son. Meanwhile Song finds the parallels between the suddenly emergent red balloon and the plotline of the Lamorisse short rather mesmerizing and films young Song with the balloon to underscore this point. For the most part Hou foregoes major story developments and simply uses screen time to witness the interaction of Song Suzanne and Simon as they live out existences of quiet despair., Juliette Binoche | Simon Iteanu | Hippolyte Girardot | Song Fang | Louise Margolin, Café Lumiere | Frozen River | Ballast | Nobody Knows | Boyhood | Half Nelson

As the third and concluding installment in the director's "musical trilogy" that began with Flamenco (1995) and Tango (1998) the film first traces the history of the fado form then moves into a veritable concert of fado all-stars (or fadistas) including Mariza Camane Caetano Veloso and others -- staged and filmed on a succession of elaborate sets such as a recreation of a period Lisbon bar. Saura also works in tributes to such past fado performers as Amália Rodrigues and Chico Buarque., Chico Buarque | Caetano Veloso | Lila Downs | Miguel Poveda | Toni Garrido, Moro No Brasil | Le Bal | Genghis Blues | Lisbon Story | Flamenco | Tango

A unique blend of conventional narrative and documentary-style filmmaking Katyn opens in the spring of 1940 just as the Soviet Secret police execute a group of Polish officers. On September 1 1939 Germen forces had descended upon Poland paving the way for the Red Army to occupy east Poland as part of the Hitler-Stalin pact. As the Red Army assumed control of east Poland all officers in the Polish army were placed in Soviet custody. Determined to remain loyal to the army despite the growing danger Polish officer Andrzej refuses to flee with his wife Anna. It isn't long before invading forces begin arresting professors in Cracow and as the detainees languish in prison camps their families start to fear that they'll never see their loved ones again. Flash forward to April 1943 and the Germans announce the discovery of mass graves. While Anna is relieved not to hear her husband's name on the list of bodies discovered countless others are left to grieve their losses with no explanation or consolation. January 18 1945: Cracow is liberated by the Red Army and propagandist newsreels from the Soviet Union blame German forces for the massacre at Katyn. It is at that point that the fine line between collaboration and resistance within the People's Republic of Poland becomes exceptionally blurred. As the details surrounding the massacre gradually begin to emerge Wajda reveals precisely how this horrifying massacre unfolded by flashing back to the spring of 1940 for an extended sequence in which Polish officer internees are transported by railroad to Smolensk and methodically dispatched before being casually buried in a mass grave., Maja Ostaszewska | Artur Zmijewski | Andrzej Chyra | Danuta Stenka | Jan Englert | Magdalena Cielecka | Pawel Malaszynski | Agnieszka Glinska | Maja Komorowska | Wladyslaw Kowalski | Antoni Pawlicki | Krzysztof Kolberger | Krzysztof Globisz | Anna Radwan | Stanislawa Celinska | Sergei Garmash, Battle of Warsaw 1920 | Defiance | The Counterfeiters | Sergeant York | The Cross of Lorraine | Rescuers: Stories of Courage - Two Couples

Despite his initial hesitancies Steidle ultimately agreed to plunge headfirst into the conflict -- and to work toward achieving social change not through violence but through peaceful humanitarian efforts. His efforts carried him to a myriad of countries and multiple continents; throughout Steidle took over 1000 photographs to document the horrors thus spreading awareness of this crisis to the remainder of the world and roundly defeating Sudanese governmental denials of the genocide.

The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile Will Elizabeth and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope however if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm.

Affording equal emphasis to each tale Keret and Geffen first hone in on Batya (Sarah Adler) a young woman employed as a caterer whose firm places strongest emphasis on weddings. As the film opens Batya breaks up with her boyfriend and struggles with her supremely dysfunctional argumentative parents who correspond with her only by leaving periodic messages on her answering machine. Her life takes a most unpredictable turn when she happens upon a tearstained little girl (Nikol Leidman) who wanders out of the ocean wearing only a pair of panties and toting an inner tube -- origin unknown. The foundling gravitates magnetically to Batya and refuses to separate from her. Meanwhile at Batya's latest assignment -- the Hebrew wedding of Michael (Gera Sandler) and Keren (Noa Knoller) -- the gorgeous bride breaks a leg while attempting to escape from a locked toilet thus inevitably delaying her honeymoon in the Caribbean. Also present at the wedding reception is a Filipino caregiver Joy (Ma-nenita De Latorre) saddled with an array of grouchy snotty elderly clients who make verbal barbs in Hebrew that she cannot understand. In her private life Joy struggles with geographical estrangement from her young son -- who still resides in the Philippines -- and remains completely aware of the irony that she's caring for nonfamilial dependents but virtually abandoning her own flesh and blood. And in yet another substory Malka (Zaharira Harifai) one of Joy's octogenarian clients gripes and moans about her own actress daughter's participation in an "experimental" version of Hamlet but demonstrates her own ability to reassure and encourage Joy. The ocean -- recurrent throughout the picture -- adds an allegorical layer to the proceedings; in the hands of Keret and Geffen it symbolizes the narrative juggle of multiple lives and the lack of self-determinism inherent in any -- the idea that all are wholly subject to the caprices of fate., Sarah Adler | Nikol Leidman | Gera Sandler | Noa Knoller | Ma-nenita De Latorre | Zharira Charifai, Sunshine State | Grand Canyon | happythankyoumoreplease | Short Cuts | Birdman | Tiny Furniture

Mesrine is played in both installments by actor Vincent Cassel who reportedly underwent massive weight gain and weight loss to convincingly portray the volatile Mesrine at various periods of his life. Director Jean-François Richet begins in 1979 with Mesrine's uncommonly violent death whereby he and a beautiful young woman are suddenly (and fatally) ambushed by Parisian police not far from Mesrine's place of birth. Richet then flashes back to the Franco-Algerian War of the late '50s and a brutal interrogation undergone by Mesrine. Following a military discharge Mesrine returns to his parents' suburb of Clichy where his dad has arranged a pathetic job for him in a lace-making factory. Never one to take humiliation lying down Jacques perceives burglary larceny and racketeering as much-superior options and decides to pursue a life of crime via a "business partnership" with childhood buddy Paul (Gilles Lellouche) who works for mobster Guido (Gérard Depardieu). As the years pass Jacques works his way up through the ranks of the underworld; via Paul he also meets and falls hard for two women: Pigalle streetwalker Sarah (Florence Thomassin) and Sofia (Elena Anaya) a beautiful Spanish woman with whom he cohabitates after doing time in a French prison. Following a brief and unsuccessful attempt to "go straight" Jacques reconnects with Guido then finds it necessary to escape from France to Canada with his new mistress Jeanne (Cécile De France). Unfortunately another prison sentence is waiting for him there replete with brutal solitary confinement but the possibility of a daring escape beckons.

Steadily entrenching himself in this unusual community yet frustrated by both the desk job and his growing disconnect with reality McGahan takes it out by arguing with his live-in girlfriend (Katie Wall). Meanwhile the lone surviving witness of the train attack (Maia Thomas) starts believing that if the gunman left her alive it wasn't for long. As the seemingly unrelated cases intertwine and McGahan both seeks his purpose and loses his grip the killer sends the message that he's still lurking.

Yoshimoto Kogyo Co., Magnet Releasing, Comedy on the Edge | Just for Fun, Down on Their Luck | Kaiju, giant Japanese [nationality] monster Japan agent [representative] divorce grandfather protection Superhero, , Director Hitoshi Matsumoto weaves this darkly comic mockumentary about a Japanese giant who continues the long-standing family tradition of facing off against Tokyo's most formidable monsters. Constantly caught in the middle of everyone's battles Daisato finds his sincere efforts to keep the peace repeatedly belittled; he's divorced his neighbors have covered his house in graffiti and he gets nothing but dirty looks when he walks down the street. When we first meet Daisato he is the subject of a television documentary. Though on the surface Daisato may seem like your average slightly unkempt salaryman -- completely unremarkable in all respects -- it soon becomes apparent just how deceiving first impressions can be. After lamenting on camera the fact that he never gets any vacation time due to frequent calls from the Defense Department the camera follows Daisato as he rides his motorbike to a Tokyo power plant receives the jolt of electricity that transforms him into a hulking superhuman crime fighter and clashes with a gargantuan leviathan intent on destroying Tokyo. Daisato comes from a long line of heroic heavyweights yet while his ancestors were once championed with parades for their noble efforts public interest in giant invaders has waned and Daisato has become something of a joke to the citizens of Tokyo. Not only is the noise generated by Daisato's battles regarded as a public nuisance the property damage that he causes while defending the city has the citizens downright angry. Now as Daisato attempts to balance his responsibilities to his ex-wife his daughter his agent and his senile grandfather the crushing weight of both his personal and professional obligations simply becomes too much to bear., Hitoshi Matsumoto | Riki Takeuchi | Ryunosuke Kamiki | Itsuji Itao | Takayuki Haranishi | Haruka Unabara | Tomoji Hasegawa | Daisuke Miyagawa | Hiroyuki Miyasako | Shion Machida, Girara No Gyakushu: Samitto Kiki Ippatsu! | Mystery Men | Ghostbusters | Ghostbusters: Answer the Call | Hellbenders | Sleeper

Equipped with the courage to fight and rid the world of the threat of terror Young anticipated an appointment in Afghanistan that would enable him to join his fellow soldiers in rooting out and bringing to justice Al-Qaeda operatives. This did not occur however and President Bush's order to invade Iraq stunned everyone including Tomas. He soon found himself shuttled off to a land that posed no obvious threat to the United States where he was instantly struck by a bullet from behind -- and rendered both paraplegic for life and unconscious. Airlifted home Tomas slowly regained awareness of himself and his surroundings settling in for a long grueling recovery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in the nation's capital with the assistance and loving support of his mother. But the young man's journey did not end there. As he lay in his hospital bed unable to move Tomas learned of the countless injuries and deaths afflicting hundreds of thousands in Iraq. In the process he became one of the nation's most ardent opponents of the Iraq invasion. With their nonfiction work Body of War longtime television pundit Phil Donahue and documentarian Ellen Spiro join forces to relay Tomas' heart-wrenching and yet deeply affirming story -- both a testament to one man's enduring inner strength and a towering condemnation of a localized conflict that owes much if not everything to the miscalculation and intrusion of the United States., , Hell and Back Again | Follow Me: The Yoni Netanyahu Story | Where Soldiers Come From | How to Fold a Flag | Home Front | Searching for Home Coming Back From War

The first segment directed by Rodriguez and entitled Planet Terror details the violent struggle between a ravenous army of zombie-like humanoids who have taken control of the planet and the remaining survivors who refuse to go down without a fight.

The program provides a sweeping 99-minute tour of our home planet's biosphere -- spanning every level of gaze from the epic (crystal-clear shots of the Earth hovering in space) to the hyper-specific (a mother polar bear and her cubs waking from a lengthy period of hibernation). The film almost exclusively emphasizes the behavior of the animal populations that inhabit the Earth yet carefully omits shots that depict the more gory predatory behavior of species rendering it family-friendly. It also employs a chronological approach -- beginning in January in the Arctic wilderness and moving progressively through the four seasons and 12 months comprising a single year until it hits late December -- contrasting various geographic regions of the Earth as shot in various seasons. Above all else a cautionary message underscores this footage; as in An Inconvenient Truth the filmmakers continually remind their audience that despite the grandiloquence present onscreen all may be lost if humankind is not careful., James Earl Jones | Patrick Stewart, Chimpanzee | Deep Blue | Deep Sea 3D | Dolphins and Whales 3D: Tribes of the Ocean | The Last Lions | Sacred Planet

Before they return to the United States Marion and Jack have a quick two-day stop in Paris to visit Marion's parents and pick up the cat that they had been pet-setting for their daughter. Unfortunately for Jack Paris proves to be quite a culture shock.

Add to this the fact that Marion's friends hold nothing back when it comes to discussing their sexual lives seem fixated on food rituals and that Marion seems to run into former lovers on every street corner and Jack quickly begins to suspect that he doesn't know his girlfriend half as well as he thought he did when they were living the simple life back in New York., Julie Delpy | Adam Goldberg | Marie Pillet | Albert Delpy | Alexia Landeau | Adan Jodorowsky | Alex Nahon | Ludovic Berthillot | Chick Ortega, 2 Days in New York | Before Midnight | L'ex de ma vie | Girl Most Likely | Sidewalks of New York | Did You Hear About the Morgans?

In 1957 Linda Riss was a receptionist in her early twenties who bore a striking resemblance to Elizabeth Taylor while attorney Burt Pugach was married and in his mid-thirties. That didn't stop Pugach from falling in love with Riss on first sight when he saw her walking past her home in the Bronx and he quickly asked her out on a date. Riss accepted and continued to see Pugach even after she discovered he had a wife. However after a year of wining and dining Riss broke off the affair convinced that Pugach would never divorce but continue to string her along. Pugach desperately tried to convince Riss to give him a second chance and began stalking her but when that failed and he learned she had decided to wed someone else he told her "If I can't have you no one else will have you and when I get through with you no one else will want you." Pugach's statement was no idle threat -- a thug hired by Pugach threw lye into Riss' face in order to scar her for life and ended up blinding her in one eye. The crime earned Pugach a 15-to-30-year prison sentence but less than a year after he was released on parole a peculiar thing happened -- Linda Riss and Burt Pugach got married. Crazy Love (aka Love Is in the Air) shares the details of this very strange love affair and how this extremely unlikely couple has stayed together for 30 years., Jimmy Breslin, Tabloid | First Lady of the Revolution | Coal Miner's Daughter | An Inconvenient Truth | Murderball | The Fog of War

In the late-'70s the city of Austin TX was ripe for change. Recognizing the remarkable potential for both growth and financial profit in such a rapidly expanding boomtown aspiring real-estate tycoon Gary Bradley set his own American dream into motion by turning a 4000-acre ranch into the biggest and fastest-selling subdivision in the entire state of Texas. His sizable development would stir controversy in the community however when the locals learned that it would likely mean the end of the delicate limestone aquifer and spring-fed swimming that had stood as a local landmark for generations. Determined not to let the precious natural resource run dry at any cost the concerned citizens decided to do everything in their power to fight the development. In the ensuing battle one of America's most powerful environmental movements was born. Robert Redford and Willie Nelson appear in a thought-provoking film that weighs the economics of the American dream against the destruction of the natural world in an effort to explore just what price we and future generations are willing to pay for the luxuries of modern living., Robert Redford | Ann Richards | Willie Nelson | Wendell Berry, The Last Mountain | Patagonia Rising | Last Call at the Oasis | Bidder 70 | Echotone | An Inconvenient Truth

In 2004 just one year after the United States launched a devastating attack on Baghdad MTV ran a story about a 25-year-old Iraqi film student named Muthana Mohmed who remained determined not to let the strife that consumed his country consume his dreams as well. At the time American actor Schreiber was preparing to make his directorial debut with the film Everything Is Illuminated. After seeing the documentary on television Schreiber was consumed by guilt for having so many amazing opportunities in the film industry and determined to give Mohmed the chance of a lifetime by inviting him to join the production of Everything Is Illuminated in the Czech Republic. Common wisdom dictates that "the road to hell is paved with good intentions" however and as Mohmed attempted to balance the complications of living away from home for the first time with the cultural issues that arise while working with an all-American film crew the situation quickly began to deteriorate., Nina Davenport | Dwayne Johnson | Peter Saraf | Liev Schreiber | Matthew Stillman, Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse | American Movie | Everything Is Copy - Nora Ephron: Scripted & Unscripted | Great Directors | A Walk Into the Sea | The Five Obstructions

At the film's center is Blake Morrison himself who for as long as he can remember has lived in the overarching shadow of his physician father Arthur (Jim Broadbent) -- falling prey to feelings of embarrassment from the old man as well as occasional awe. In the 1950s when Blake (Bradley Johnson) was a child the boy watched as Arthur partook in socially uncouth behavior such as wheedling his way into clubs to which he didn't belong and carrying on an extramarital affair with the full knowledge of his wife Kim (Juliet Stevenson). As the years passed teenage Blake's (Matthew Beard) discomfort around his father hardened into resentment -- particularly when the adolescent boy expressed interest in a girl Rachel (Carey Mulligan) who clearly preferred his father; compounding the situation Blake then had to suffer through Arthur's decision to publicly humiliate his son in front of everyone. The central dynamic has changed for the two however by the late '80s when Blake -- now married to Kathy (Gina McKee) and freshly established as a successful novelist and poet -- learns that Arthur has contracted terminal cancer. Now the junior Morrison takes a headfirst plunge into the memories and recollections of his youth -- and grapples with the dynamic of his relationship with Arthur for the first time in his life as he comes face to face with the need to provide loving care for the old man., Jim Broadbent | Colin Firth | Juliet Stevenson | Gina McKee | Elaine Cassidy | Claire Skinner | Matthew Beard | Justin McDonald | Sarah Lancashire, The Myth of Fingerprints | The City of Your Final Destination | Nothing in Common | James White | East of Eden | The Last Picture Show

Pellington Owens and cinematographers Tom Krueger and Peter Anderson make frequent use of a roving camera and multi-layered 3-D effects; they also step away from the approach utilized in the band's previous concert film U2: Rattle and Hum by omitting interviews and focusing exclusively on concert footage.

Seven years later when the jurors delivered their final verdict in a notoriously prejudiced trial both men were condemned to death despite massive protests both in the U.S. and abroad.

Hagar may by 90 but she not ready to lie down and die just yet. Her decisions stem straight from her heart and that often alienates her family and friends. When Hagar's son Marvin (Dylan Baker) takes his mother to look at a nursing home she takes it as her cue to leave her family behind and set out on one great last journey. Her mission is to locate the seaside home she remembers from her youth but Hagar's memory is quickly fading making it difficult for her to distinguish the past from the present. As a young girl Hagar was set to inherit her father's mercantile empire until she was disowned for marrying a bold young man named Bram Shipley (Cole Hauser). Later when Hagar's romantic illusions fade and she begins to view her husband with contempt her decision to deny her children the kind of parental approval that she so badly longed for from her own father provokes a deep hereditary flaw. As she makes her way toward the seashore Hagar realizes her time is running far too short to make up for a lifetime of unacknowledged mistakes., Ellen Burstyn | Christine Horne | Cole Hauser | Ellen Page | Sheila McCarthy | Kevin Zegers | Dylan Baker | Samantha Weinstein | Luke Kirby | Connor Price | Jordan Todosey | Ardith Boxall | Ted Atherton | Aaron Ashmore | Peter MacNeill | Joyce Krenz | Sarah Constible | Alicia Johnston | Jason Spevack | David Gillies | Devon Bostick | Josette Halpert | Frank Adamson | Wings Hauser | Janet-Laine Green | Peter Jordan | Ross McMillan | Sharon Bajer | Marcia Bennett | Greg Lowe, Giant | Terms of Endearment | The Notebook | The Savages | The Best Years of Our Lives | To Kill a Mockingbird

Via scores of in-court legal battles Rosset fought aggressively and valiantly to defend the release of works as varied as William S. Burroughs' novel Naked Lunch Henry Miller's novel Tropic of Cancer and Vilgot Sjöman's classic arthouse film I Am Curious (Yellow). As co-directed by Neil Ortenberg and Daniel O'Connor the documentary Obscene builds a case not only for the idea that Rosset was utterly indispensable in the battle for freedom of speech that descended on America in the late '60s and early '70s but that he deserves hearty praise for championing works that pushed accepted moral standards into theretofore unacceptable territory. Via a combination of extensive archival footage and interviews Obscene traces Rosset's professional and personal life beginning with his early years at the Parker School and Swarthmore through his involvement in the armed forces and his presence in the Manhattan avant-garde with wife Joan Mitchell during the late '40s and early '50s. The film places heaviest emphasis on (and devotes most of its screen time to) Rosset's censorship battles for various works during the mid- to late '60s before moving into an exploration of his troubled subsequent years that were marked by financial difficulty violent attacks from disapproving groups government surveillance and a host of other complications.

Comprised of Gary Burger Larry Clark Dave Day Roger Johnston and Eddie Shaw five American GI's stationed in Hamburg Germany during the height of the Cold War the Monks started out as a cover band called the Torquays playing the hits of the day to blow off steam while they waited out their commitments to the Army. However the band members had some more ambitious ideas and when they met Karl-H. Remy and Walther Nieman a pair of Germans with an interest in music and contemporary art interested in managing a rock band they reinvented themselves as the Monks. Wearing all-black clothing bits of rope as neckties and sporting tonsures shaved into their scalps the Monks played noisy stripped-down rock with a fierce propulsive beat fuzzy guitars an amplified banjo and lyrics that were openly critical of the military and the standard social order. While the Monks developed a small but loyal following and appeared occasionally on German television the group was simply too unconventional to attract a large audience and after the commercial failure of their album Black Monk Time the group split up in 1967. However the band's reputation lived on and the album became a cult favorite among record collectors and fans of pre-punk garage rock. The album was belatedly released in the United States in 1997 and the group reformed to play a reunion show at New York City's Cavestomp Festival in 1999.

Produced to coincide with the 50th anniversary of this defining moment in human history this documentary from filmmaker David Hoffman draws on lost footage and informative interviews to detail the remarkable story surrounding the launch of Sputnik as well as the incredible events that unfolded in America the following year. While American enthusiasm over this technological breakthrough was at first palpable that excitement quickly turned to dread as politicians and the media pointed out that the same rocket used to propel Sputnik into space could have just as easily been outfitted with a nuclear warhead and used to launch a devastating war against the United States. The following year tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States reached an all-time high effectively propelling the Cold War into overdrive. With bomb shelters being built nuclear testing lighting up the atmosphere every three days and then-senator Lyndon B.

Melvin B. Tolson (Washington) is the kind of educator who truly recognizes the remarkable power of knowledge. An outspoken Wiley College professor who boldly challenged the discriminatory Jim Crow laws of the 1930s Tolson's recognizes that his young debate students possess the spark of a new generation. Convinced that they could invoke great change if given the confidence and tools needed to do so the tireless educator implores his students to take responsibility for the future while furtively attempting to protect them from his clandestine role as an organizer for the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. Chief among Tolson's promising young students is a 14-year-old prodigy named James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker). Farmer's father James Sr. (Forest Whitaker) is a renowned scholar and an important presence in the emerging student's life. Yet despite his formidable reputation James Sr. has not yet learned how to truly harness the power of knowledge through action and assertion. James Jr. has seen the raving effects of racism all around him and longs to live in a future where no one must be in fear simply because of the color of their skin. Other talented debaters on Tolson's team include fiercely independent student Henry Lowe (Nate Parker) and Samantha Brooke (Jurnee Smollett) -- the first ever female ever to join the Wiley College debate team. While most educators may not have recognized the remarkable potential of assembling such a disparate team Tolson's unique vision truly set him apart from the pack as the team begins to experience a series of consecutive victories on their road to challenging Harvard at the National Championships., Denzel Washington | Forest Whitaker | Nate Parker | Jurnee Smollett | Denzel Whitaker | Jermaine Williams | Gina Ravera | John Heard | Kimberly Elise | Devyn Tyler | Trenton McClain Boyd | Ritchie Montgomery | Jackson Walker | Tim Parati | Robert X.

Gerard Butler stars as Spartan King Leonidas and Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo. The massive army of the Persian Empire is sweeping across the globe crushing every force that dares stand in its path. When a Persian envoy arrives in Sparta offering King Leonidas power over all of Greece if he will only bow to the will of the all powerful Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) the strong-willed leader assembles a small army comprised of his empire's best fighters and marches off to battle. Though they have virtually no hope of defeating Xerxes' intimidating battalion Leonidas' men soldier on intent on letting it be known they will bow to no man but their king. Meanwhile back in Sparta the loyal Queen Gorgo attempts to convince both the skeptical council and the devious Theron (Dominic West) to send more troops despite the fact that many view Leonidas' unsanctioned war march as a serious transgression. As Xerxes' fearsome "immortals" draw near a few noble Greeks vow to assist the Spartans on the battlefield. When King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors fell to the overwhelming Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae the fearless actions of the noble fighters inspired all of Greece to stand up against their Persian enemy and wage the battle that would ultimately give birth to the modern concept of democracy., Gerard Butler | Lena Headey | Dominic West | David Wenham | Vincent Regan | Michael Fassbender | Tom Wisdom | Andrew Pleavin | Andrew Tiernan | Rodrigo Santoro | Giovani Antonio Cimmino | Stephen McHattie | Greg Kramer | Alex Ivanovici | Kelly Craig | Tyler Neitzel | Tim Connolly | Marie-Julie Rivest | Peter Mensah | Arthur Holden | Michael Sinelnikoff | John Dunn-Hill | Dennis St. John | Neil Napier | Dylan Scott Smith | Maurizio Terrazzano | Robert Paradis | Kwasi Songui | Alexandra Beaton | Loucas Minchillo | Nicholas Minchillo | Tom Rack | David J.

A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They too long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A.

Twenty-year-old Jane Austen (Anne Hathaway) is the daughter of Rev. Austen (James Cromwell) a minister who looks after a flock in a small rural community in Southern England with his wife (Julie Walters). While her older sister Cassandra (Anna Maxwell Martin) is engaged to be married Jane resists her family's efforts to match her up with Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox) the wealthy but dull nephew of Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith) a minor member of the British nobility. Jane has the heart of an artist and hopes to distinguish herself as a musician or a writer though her parents don't think much of her prospects. When Jane meets Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy) a young man her own age she's intrigued; while he scoffs at her writing style he clearly sees she has talent and is eager for her to learn more of the larger world by exposing her to more daring literature and modern pastimes such as boxing. As Tom begins to court Jane she finds herself increasingly attracted to this poor but keenly intelligent man though she soon realizes her own ideas about love and marriage are sometimes at odds with the conventions of the society in which she lives., Anne Hathaway | James McAvoy | Julie Walters | James Cromwell | Maggie Smith | Anna Maxwell Martin | Lucy Cohu | Laurence Fox | Ian Richardson | Joe Anderson | Leo Bill | Jessica Ashworth | Eleanor Methven | Michael James Ford | Tom Vaughan-Lawlor | Elaine Murphy | Guy Carleton | Russell Smith | Philip Culhane | Helen McCrory | Louise Marie Kerr | Sophie Vavasseur | Gina Costigan | Chris McHallem, Austen Country: The Life and Times of Jane Austen | Sense and Sensibility | Emma | Austenland | Miss Potter | Jane Austen in Manhattan

Evincing great sensitivity to both the subject matter and the interviewees Sharma hones in on a transcontinental group of homosexual individuals who attempt to reconcile their faith in the Koran (where according to many interpretations same-sex relations are condemned) with their non-heterosexual identities. Hailing from countries as diverse as France South Africa Turkey and India these individuals typically find themselves in a delicate position; forced to hide their private lives in their native Muslim communities under fear of death the next best option that exists involves immigrating out of the Middle East and thus abandoning their home cultures. At the core of her film Sharma suggests that the answer may lie in an unusual source of hope: the devout individuals who in lieu of relinquishing Islam make the difficult and commendable decision to try to reconcile their sexual and romantic proclivities with their Islamic faith., , Word Is Out: Stories of Some of Our Lives | Coming Out Under Fire | Fish Out of Water | Outrage | Call Me Kuchu | Tying the Knot

Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is an author who specializes in horror but who only believes in what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands. Having constructed an entire career on his ability to dispel superstitious "haunted house" rumors Mike is convinced that the afterlife is a manmade construct designed to offer false comfort to the weak minded. Mike's latest project is a book entitled "Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms" and it seems that in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel this skeptical scribe may finally find proof of the supernatural. Implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) not to enter room 1408 Mike defiantly procures the key and prepares to dispel yet another spectral sham. Now as is the case with many of life's most profound epiphanies the writer who thought he knew it all is caught entirely off guard at the precise moment he least expected it. Subsequently faced with undeniable proof of an afterlife Mike may have a best-seller on his hands if he can simply survive until sunrise.

The patriarch Dorian "Doc" Paskowitz began life on a commendable even enviable course with an M.D. under his arm rippling sandy-haired good looks and experience almost single-handedly teaching the country of Israel how to surf. But in the years to follow bitterness and inveterate disappointment ensued as Dr. Paskowitz tried to settle into a conventional existence. Two broken marriages and a medical career that Dorian would later describe as "miserable" left him clawing his way out desperate for an "alternative" lifestyle. He soon met courted and married his third wife a ravishing sexy young woman named Juliette; these two free spirits jointly decided that they would live life budding family in-tow on the open road in a series of low-budget trailers. As one child after another cropped up over the course of a decade the family toured the country winning one surfing competition after another and Dr. Paskowitz accepted low-rent medical jobs for the poor that reeled in little to no income. In theory this all seemed idealistic even utopian; in reality Dorian Paskowitz was reportedly a severe disciplinarian who denied his children the benefits of school and financial security forced everyone to stick to an almost unbearable diet of a gruel-like substance and -- even more alarmingly -- felt comfortable having open and noisy sex with his wife with the children only a few feet away. In time as one child after another grew up left the clan and attempted to survive they found it difficult if not impossible to function in the day-to-day world without the education social skills and monetary know-how that so many young adults take for granted.

But what they will find instead is Ellison more or less unchained and ranging (and raging) across his past and into the future (circa 2007) having great fun with his many and varied targets and giving his own accounts of some of the triumphs that people often cite in his past. Perhaps the most satisfying moment comes when the author presents his version of one portion (one of the least controversial portions) of his Hugo Award-winning script for the Star Trek episode "The City on the Edge of Forever" -- he ends up making the production crew for the series look like fools and longing to see the story told as he wrote it. By contrast presented without comment is one excerpt of the award-winning Outer Limits episode "Demon With a Glass Hand" which apparently was shot more or less as he wrote it. In between and around these two polar opposite successes of his early career Ellison rails and laughs berates and curses and generally has a great deal of fun launching his barbs at a multitude of targets including himself as often as not. One eerie aspect of watching him across this fast-paced account which covers many decades of his life is realizing how much Ellison resembles the late actor George Grizzard as he looked and sounded from the 1960s to the 21st century -- if there was an actor who might've portrayed this unique personality in a dramatic context it was Grizzard. But much more important than any such mundane observations is the keen appreciation that the filmmaker has for his subject sufficient to take us on what amounts to a cinematic roller-coaster ride across one part of Ellison's psyche. That's how it's paced and that how it's best to take in this delightfully quirky and lively nonfiction film., Harlan Ellison | Robin Williams | Neil Gaiman, Strange Is Normal: The Amazing Life of Colin Wilson | James Ellroy: American Dog | The Oscar | Coal Miner's Daughter | An Inconvenient Truth | Murderball

As the days go on and the noise on the street seems to amplify in David's ears he makes the decision to take up arms against the unseen intruder. Initially David is content to simply let the air out of tires or leave notes on windshields when the owners of cars fail to turn off their alarms. When this approach fails to yield acceptable results David's subversive urban sabotage techniques quickly evolve into full-blown acts of vandalism. Eventually David is caught in the act and arrested by the police. After spending a night in jail David confesses to his wife that he is in fact the urban folk hero who has come to be known by the public as "The Rectifier" for his repeated attempts to hold those responsible for urban noise pollution accountable for their auditory transgressions. When his wife voices concern about such extreme and irrational behavior David dutifully agrees to give up his career as a noise-fighting vigilante. But try as he might David simply cannot repress his lingering urge to strike back against such a formidable enemy., Tim Robbins | Bridget Moynahan | William Hurt | Margarita Levieva | Gabrielle Brennan | Maria Ballesteros | William Baldwin | Keir O'Donnell | Jessica Almasy | Ramon Fernandez | Maryam Myika Day, Boxes | Safe | Turk 182! | M*A*S*H | Birdman | Bullets Over Broadway

Born and raised in a troubled household Barnes grew up with few desires other than getting rich and he did just that. Barnes was a drug dealer who promoted himself as the man with the best heroin and cocaine in New York City and between 1970 and 1975 he became the wealthiest and most powerful illegal drug dealer in America. Heading an underground organization known as "The Council" Barnes had a handful of top drug peddlers working under him and shrewdly aligned himself with Mafia-connected drug importers cutting out middlemen and offering himself a measure of protection at the same time. The booming market for heroin and cocaine (drugs Barnes himself used with enthusiasm) made Barnes a multi-millionaire but as pride comes before a fall Barnes' certainty that the police could not catch up with him led to his downfall as one of his underlings unwittingly gave him up to authorities. In time Barnes went into the FBI's Witness Protection Program and obtained his freedom by informing on the associates who helped make him a success. Barnes co-authored an autobiography in 2007 and filmmaker Marc Levin persuaded Barnes to tell his story on camera (though without revealing his face); Levin's interviews formed the basis of Mr. Untouchable a documentary on Barnes' rise fall and disappearance into Middle America. Barnes' story was also featured in another 2007 release American Gangster a fact-based drama which portrays both Barnes and another powerful drug kingpin Frank Lucas., , American Gangster | Casino Jack and the United States of Money | O.J.: Made in America | After Innocence | Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer | Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father

Growing thoroughly sick of the wet cold and clammy London weather Mr. Bean (Atkinson) finds just the right tonic when he wins a trip to sunny southern France all expenses paid with a new digital video camera to accompany him. However he runs headfirst into a series of outrageous and unpleasant situations such as winding up in a French restaurant where a maître d' (Jean Rochefort) convinces him to eat bizarre varieties of seafood that he's never before encountered and discovering that the "Very Fast Train" certainly lives up to its name. Eventually Mr. Bean (accompanied by a Russian traveling companion whom he meets along his journey) stumbles onto the French Riviera and spoils the latest movie production of snobbish egomaniacal filmmaker Carson Clay (Willem Dafoe) -- little realizing that his own klutzy video footage will accidentally end up in Clay's film and be screened at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival.

Alex Fletcher (Grant) may have been all the rage in the 1980s but these days he's lucky to get a gig playing at the local county fair. Just when it seems as if things couldn't get any more bleak for the dejected has-been rocker reigning pop diva Cora Corman (Haley Bennett) offers Alex the opportunity of a lifetime -- write and record a duet to be sung with her and watch his career receive a much-needed boost as the nostalgia-crazed public laps it up. Little does Cora realize that not only has it been years since Alex has written a song but he's never actually written a single lyric. Now if he hopes to make the comeback needed to save him from a life of complete and utter obscurity Alex will have to craft a radio-friendly hit in a matter of mere days. Luckily for Alex his quirky plant-keeper Sophie Fisher (Barrymore) has quite a way with words and may possess just the kind of songwriting talent needed to make such a hit happen. Unfortunately the beguiling Sophie is still reeling from a recent break-up with newly famous novelist Sloan Cates (Campbell Scott) and she isn't quite sure if she's ready for any kind of collaboration right now -- romantic or otherwise. Despite Alex's hesitation to commit and Sophie's reluctance to collaborate the pair quickly discovers that a little chemistry can go a long way in healing the wounds of the past and laying the foundation for a much-deserved future of happiness and success., Hugh Grant | Drew Barrymore | Brad Garrett | Kristen Johnston | Haley Bennett | Aasif Mandvi | Campbell Scott | Jason Antoon | Matthew Morrison | Toni Trucks | Scott Porter, Stars 80 | Down With Love | Bridget Jones's Diary | Notting Hill | When Harry Met Sally | Picture Perfect

Jason Creed (Joshua Close) and his crew are shooting a mummy movie in the Pennsylvania woods when media reports begin pouring in about the dead rising from their graves to feast on the flesh of the living. While self-centered star Ridley (Phillip Riccio) beats a hasty retreat to his family's fortified mansion halfway across the state the remaining cast and crew are forced to fight for their lives despite having no weapons to speak of and only a wobbly recreational vehicle in which to seek shelter.

This motion picture gains a historical footnote as the first U.S. mainstream movie to depict events solely through the "eyes" of surveillance video cameras. The preponderance of action unfurls in San Fernando Valley offices stores and shopping malls where we witness security-camera footage of character interactions and events that would likely never occur if the perpetrators knew they were being "watched." In one subplot Marty (Ben Weber) a beleaguered insurance salesman alienated by his co-workers makes brazenly sexual passes at his female colleagues secretly hatching a darker plan of his own on the side. Meanwhile in another locale -- that of a department store at the Northridge Fashion Center shopping mall -- a chauvinistic floor manager named Tony takes full-scale sexual advantage of each of his female co-workers letting all his inhibitions fly out the window in the "secrecy" of the back room. And in the same store two minors Holly (Heather Hogan) and Sherri (Spencer Redford) shop for seductive apparel in a twisted plot to seduce and presumably blackmail a high-school instructor. On a darker note Rifkin follows convenience-store employees attempting to "bring down" a cadre of serial murderers tagged as "The Candid Camera Killers" whose doings attract the attention of police cameras. Other perspectives included in the film include those of ATM cameras robot security cameras and all sorts of other surveillance devices of varying ingenuity all of which catch shocking behavior and are used to follow a myriad of substories., Jamie McShane | Spencer Redford | Hayes MacArthur | Nichelle Hines | Ben Weber | Paul Schackman | Chris Williams | Jennifer Fontaine | Giuseppe Andrews | Miles Dougal | Rhys Coiro | Sebastian Feldman | Kimberly Quinn | Heather Hogan | Ryan Cutrona | Valerie Breiman, Timecode | New York Stories | Hotel | Twenty Bucks | Shampoo | Birdman

Haring also created images for charitable and political groups and he was at the peak of his fame when he succumbed to AIDS-related illness in 1990 at the age of 32.

All optimistic saccharine on the surface but a steamroller underneath she refuses to tolerate any pessimism cynicism depression or anxiety from her patients.

All of these patients can deal with Tori's irritating positivism -- more or less. But not so with Geirr (Fridtjov Saheim) a paraplegic from a traffic accident who spends his days drowning himself in booze chain-smoking cigarettes and listening to suicidally depressing Johnny Cash ballads.

When reclusive detective Stan Aubray (Willem Dafoe) gunned down the man suspected of being the "Uncle Eddie" murderer he thought his nightmare had come to an end. But now a new crop of victims has begun to turn up each bearing the distinctive mark of the maniac whom everyone had presumed to be dead.

Could this be the work of a copycat killer or is it possible that Detective Aubray and his men killed the wrong man on that fateful day five years ago?

Only by confronting the possibility that he fears most will Detective Aubray finally be able to overcome his own stifling sense of guilt and finally uncover the truth about the most gruesome crimes ever committed in New York City., Willem Dafoe | Scott Speedman | Clea DuVall | James Rebhorn | Peter Stormare | Amy Carlson | Yul Vázquez | Deborah Harry | Don Harvey | Paz de la Huerta | Paul Lazar | Lucy Martin | Mick Foley | Sharrieff Pugh | Ashley Springer | Amir Arison | Edward Hibbert | Barbara Sicuranza | Robert G.

In the framing sequences comedian Paul Rudd (who collaborated with much of the cast on Wet Hot American Summer and The Baxter) stands on a black stage with giant Biblical tablets projected behind him and promises to deliver ten mini-stories each loosely based on one of the commandments from "Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods Before Me" through "Thou Shalt Not Covet." For all of the storyteller's efforts however he is constantly comically distracted by interferences particularly those emanating from intrusions by his multiple girlfriends. The stories are nonetheless told one by one in short-film form beginning with a sketch in which Stephen (Adam Brody) goes skydiving with his intended Kelly (Winona Ryder) but forgets to wear his parachute and gets stuck in the mud waist-deep which draws gawkers media and in time worshipers. Several of the subsequent stories consist of raunchy jet-black riffs on sexual perversion including one about a virginal librarian (Gretchen Mol) entangled in a sultry and messy affair with a Mexican and another memorable bit about a nutty surgeon who plays a prank by burying a pair of scissors in a patient's stomach and is then sent to prison -- where he experiences brutal sexual abuse at the hands of other men.

Gold / Judith Helfand, Toxic Comedy Pictures, , Food for Thought, , activism environmentalism global-warming grassroots message movement [social change], , Global warming has been the most significant environmental issue to come to the public's attention in the final quarter of the Twentieth Century. But while most people know what global warming is convincing folks that it's a real and present danger has been a difficult task especially since a number of Republican political leaders and leading figures in multi-national business have used their power and influence to question the facts behind the issue or dismiss scientific evidence as tree-hugging hysteria. The grassroots efforts of environmental activists to spread the word about the very real dangers of this looming crisis are chronicled in Everything's Cool a documentary which focuses on a wide variety of concerned people working to shift public opinion from author Ross Gelbspan and former Vice President Al Gore to ordinary citizens who use chat at work and in elevators to spread the message. The film also looks at how activists used the big-budget sci-fi film The Day After Tomorrow as a springboard to push global warming into public consciousness.

In that earlier picture Tucker and Epperlein stumble across Yunis Khatayer Abbas a Middle Eastern man who merely confesses "I am a journalist" before American soldiers drag him off to incarceration. The Tuckers reconnected with Abbas at a later point and disinter his backstory in this film. Tortured by the goons of Saddam Hussein's brother Uday Hussein Abbas later became a key terrorist suspect of the U.S. government who believed that he intended to kill British prime minister Tony Blair. American authorities had Abbas thrown into the notorious Abu Ghirab prison (and other penitentiaries) and subjected him to month after month of grueling interrogation. Eventually they released him - with a one-word apology. Tucker and Epperlein recount Abbas's story with an unusual approach: in lieu of a straight documentary the filmmakers employ a comic-book iconography with over 150 onscreen illustrations of Abbas's plight by Epperlein intercut with clips from Abbas's home movies and glimpses of U.S. Army documents - all of which detail the sad absurdities that befell him., Tony Blair, Gunner Palace | Paper Clips | BattleGround: 21 Days on the Empire's Edge | Voices of Iraq | An Inconvenient Truth | The Fog of War

But what do these passages really mean? How accurate is their translation from the original holy texts? And have they been used outside of proper context to justify a political agenda that runs counter to Christian ideals of acceptance and forgiveness? For The Bible Tells Me So is a documentary which looks at the ongoing battle of gays and lesbians to celebrate their faith without denying their sexual preferences. The film includes interviews with a number of conservative Christian families as well as V. Gene Robinson who became the first officially ordained Anglican bishop; political activist and spiritual leader Bishop Desmond Tutu; and Chrissy Gephardt the openly lesbian daughter of Congressman Dick Gephardt.

The tale begins in the 1970s when hooligan Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett) finds himself implicated in a series of violent skirmishes on the soccer fields of England. Prompted to leave this activity and enter another trade Leach self-incorporates as a company called ICF - a front for the young entrepreneur's drug-dealing activities. Soon Carlton's business flourishes - first with cocaine then with ecstasy and heroin (as time rolls forward from the self-serving 80s into the 1990s) but with it comes severe addiction and disturbingly wave after wave of nerve-wracking violence. More hardened more severe criminals turn up to do business with Carlton's associates forcing Carlton to recruit tougher and more psychopathic elements to protect himself - particularly when the goods from a heroin shipment disappear and Turkish thugs begin closing in., Ricci Harnett | Craig Fairbrass | Terry Stone | Roland Manookian | Coralie Rose | Neil Maskell | Ian Virgo | Kierston Wareing | Patrick Regis | Lara Belmont | Emily Beecham | Billy Murray | Frank Harper, Collateral | The French Connection | True Romance | The Dope Game | American Gangster | Dog Day Afternoon

The county sheriff (Nestor Paiva) tentatively identifies the dead man as Eric Jacobs a laboratory assistant to Professor Deemer (Leo G. Carroll) a research scientist living a few miles out in the desert. But there's something strange about Jacobs; his facial features and bodily extremities are distorted to a point where he's barely recognizable. The sheriff calls in Dr. Matt Hastings (John Agar) the local physician who makes a diagnosis of acromegalia a glandular disorder that affects the body's growth. He also tells the sheriff that it can't possibly be acromegalia because symptoms as pronounced as those he sees in this case take years to develop and the man was in perfect health just three months earlier. Hastings refuses to believe the professor's account of Jacobs' rapid deterioration but the sheriff takes the word of the scientist. Back in his laboratory Deemer continues his work going over tests of a chemical on various animals all of which are jumbo-sized including guinea pigs the size of rabbits baby mice the size of full-grown rats and a tarantula three feet long. Suddenly the professor is attacked by his assistant (Eddie Parker) whose face and hands are distorted in the same manner as Jacobs and who injects the helpless scientist with the experimental chemical before collapsing dead. A fire starts during the attack and in the confusion the tarantula's glass cage is broken and it escapes the burning laboratory wandering out into the desert. Weeks go by and a new assistant Stephanie "Steve" Clayton (Mara Corday) arrives to begin work for the professor. When Hastings gives her a ride to Deemer's home the scientist explains to the doctor that he's been working on a radioactive nutrient that if perfected could feed the entire world's population. He also says that Eric Jacobs made the mistake of testing the chemical on himself and it caused the disease that killed him. Hastings and Steve begin a romance unaware that wandering around the desert is the tarantula from Deemer's laboratory now grown to the size of an automobile and getting bigger with each passing day. Soon livestock and then people begin disappearing and the sheriff is at a loss to explain any of it or the one clue left behind in each case: large pools of what seems to be some kind of venom next to the stripped skeletons of the victims. Hastings takes some of the material in for a test; meanwhile Steve notices that Deemer is going through some bizarre changes. His mood has darkened and his features now appear to be changing as the acromegalia caused by the injection manifests itself. Hastings learns that one of the professor's test animals was a tarantula which was presumed destroyed. When he learns that the pools near the deaths are composed of spider venom -- equivalent to what it would take many thousands of spiders to generate -- he's certain that the tarantula from the laboratory survived. By this time the title creature is bigger than a house and ravaging the countryside killing everything in its path and knocking down power lines and telephone poles as it moves. Hastings arrives just in time to rescue Steve from the attacking creature which destroys Deemer's house and kills the professor. The sheriff and the highway patrol are unable to slow the creature now the size of a mountain and moving at 45 miles an hour even with automatic rifle fire as it follows the road through the desert toward the town. Even an attempt to blow it up with dynamite fails when the monster walking right through the blast. Finally the creature is poised to attack the town when jets scrambled from a nearby Air Force base (led by a young Clint Eastwood barely recognizable behind an oxygen mask) swoop in. When rockets fail to divert the monster from its path the jets roar in for a second pass and drop enough napalm to incinerate the creature., John Agar | Mara Corday | Leo G.
