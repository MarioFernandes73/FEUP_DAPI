Omar (Riz Ahmed) is a devout Muslim living in the United Kingdom who has decided to form a terrorist cell to bring forth a jihad against a culture he believes is dominated by the sinful and ignorant. However Omar isn't much of leader and he's assembled an unimpressive team of fellow terrorists among them Waj (Kayvan Novak) who lacks the brainpower to come up with ideas or direction on his own; Faisal (Adeel Akhtar) who is shy and doesn't have much to say; and Barry (Nigel Lindsay) a recent convert to Islam who tries to make up for his lack of practical knowledge with fierce passion. As Omar and his comrades debate both doctrine and methods they ponder such notions as using birds as explosive devices creating video communiqués with a hip-hop flavor and attacking mosques in an effort to provoke nonviolent Muslims.

The son of a tough Charlestown MA thief Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug's crew one of the most ruthless in Boston but they're also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence and always make a clean break. Over the years Doug's fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him; Jem (Jeremy Renner) the most dangerous of the bunch is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage during a particularly tense heist and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance and becomes convinced that she doesn't suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang Doug finds himself falling for Claire and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug's true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he's ever known., Ben Affleck | Rebecca Hall | Jon Hamm | Jeremy Renner | Blake Lively | Slaine | Owen Burke | Titus Welliver | Pete Postlethwaite | Chris Cooper | Corena Chase | Brian Scannell | Tony V. | Michael Yebba | Jimmy Joe Maher | Michael Malvesti | Jack Neary | Ben Hanson | Brian A.

The images they captured ran the gamut from blasé scenes of day-to-day life to horrific moments of death and despair. The film was never completed but after the war the unedited footage running roughly an hour was discovered in a German archive. Yael Hersonski's documentary Shtikat Haarchion (aka A Film Unfinished) presents the surviving footage of the Warsaw ghetto in full for the first time; along with the archival images Hersonski includes interviews with five survivors of the ghetto who talk about what was captured on film and their lives under the Nazis as well as a member of the camera crew who offers a perspective on the original intended slant of the film (which was at least in part meant to reveal the class differences between Jews of different economic status).

Aura befriends Jed (Alex Karpovsky) a minor celebrity thanks to his surreal YouTube videos who insists he's in New York to take meetings for an upcoming TV project; he soon invites himself into Aura's bedroom as a semi-permanent guest though he clearly has no interest in any sort of romantic or sexual relationship. With little else to do Aura takes a job at a nearby restaurant and becomes smitten with Keith (David Call) one of the cooks; while he seems attracted to her he also has a girlfriend and it isn't until they're both stoned one night that he makes his move in a rather unusual setting.

So what happens to a generation who have the expectations of their childhood turned upside down? Filmmaker Robin Hessman profiles five people who were raised in the Soviet Union only to come of age as the U.S.S.R. was dissolved and rickety versions of democracy and capitalism rose in its wake in the documentary My Perestroika. Lyuba was raised in a patriotic household and was horrified by television images of chaos in America while Borya raised in a Jewish household knew firsthand about the inequalities of the Soviet system and viewed authority with a wary eye. Today Lyuba and Borya are married and work as schoolteachers living with their children in a cramped flat but aware that in a nation that no longer guarantees housing to its people they're fortunate to have what they have. Olga was the prettiest girl in her class and imagined that a grand future lay before her; now she's a single mother who has trouble supporting herself and her daughter renting pool tables to bars and nightspots.

The year was 2003. As prohibitively expensive technology became affordable to the masses and the Internet made it easy to stay in touch with people who were halfway across the world Harvard undergrad and computer programming wizard Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) launched a website with the potential to alter the very fabric of our society. At the time Zuckerberg was just six years away from making his first million. But his hearty payday would come at a high price because despite all of Zuckerberg's wealth and success his personal life began to suffer as he became mired in legal disputes and discovered that many of the 500 million people he had friended during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. Chief among that growing list of detractors was Zuckerberg's former college friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) whose generous financial contributions to Facebook served as the seed that helped the company to sprout. And some might argue that Zuckerberg's bold venture wouldn't have evolved into the cultural juggernaut that it ultimately became had Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) not spread the word about Facebook to the venture capitalists from Silicon Valley. Meanwhile the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) engage Zuckerberg in a fierce courtroom battle for ownership of Facebook that left many suspecting the young entrepreneur might have let his greed eclipse his better judgment.

This question comes to mind while considering the life of photographer Francesca Woodman. Francesca grew up in a creative household -- her mother Betty Woodman worked in ceramics; her father George Woodman was a painter; and her brother Charlie Woodman became a video artist. From an early age Francesca was taught about the importance and value of art and she displayed a precocious gift as a photographer. In 1975 at the age of 17 Francesca began creating remarkable and unusual images often featuring nude women and after studying in Italy and at the Rhode Island School of Design she seemed on the verge of a long and distinguished career until she committed suicide in early 1981 just days before the opening of the first major exhibition of her work.

The date of origin made these some of the oldest remnants of humankind ever discovered. Unsurprisingly these artistic remnants bore a precious fragility -- experts asserted that overexposure even to elements as seemingly harmless as human breath could severely damage or destroy the drawings. For that reason few obtained access to this area. One exception arrived in the form of maverick German filmmaker Werner Herzog who not only obtained permission to film (with lights that emit no heat) but did so in 3D -- a process that enabled him to convey the textured surfaces on which the figures are drawn as well as the shape and depth of the cave's stalagmites and other structures. This astonishing 3D documentary not only provides exquisite visual detail of the cave (as Herzog explores it) but uses the visuals as a springboard to broader philosophical questions about the nature of humanity itself and the transience of humankind., Werner Herzog, Grizzly Man | The Wild Blue Yonder | Gone: The Disappearance of Aeryn Gillern | Pina | Into the Abyss | The White Diamond

In response fellow filmmaker Mojtaba Mirtahmasb teamed up with Panahi to create In Film Nist (aka This Is Not a Film) in which Panahi ponders the past and current state of his career as well as the screenplay he was planning to shoot shortly before his sentence was handed down. As Panahi stages a reading of the script in his home (with Mirtahmasb capturing the action on video as other friends and family members occasionally function as "director" via messages and phone calls) Panahi demonstrates the blocking and camera angles he had in mind using taped diagrams on his living-room floor and the two filmmakers explore the nebulous line between making a film and talking about how one would make a film in front of a camera.

Putty Hill is a working-class neighborhood in Baltimore that has seen better days; the economic downturn has hit the town hard and many of the area's young people seem to have little in the way of ambition or a future. Cory was a young man from Putty Hill who has died of a heroin overdose; while it seems that everyone knew him no one knew him very well -- not even his family who had fallen out of contact with him as his drug use increased. Despite that Cory's family and circle of friends come together for his funeral and in the day leading up to the memorial people gather in the neighborhood hangouts to remember who they've lost and talk about their own lives and where they want to go.

Shot using high-definition video equipment and a consumer-grade cell phone with the crisp images of the former playing off the grain and distortion of the latter Film Socialisme is divided into three segments. The first takes place on a luxury liner cruising the Mediterranean as tourists from different lands attempt to communicate in their different languages. In the second a French family calls a private tribunal as the children challenge their parents on the issues of Liberty Equality and Fraternity while the media watches from outside. And finally Godard and his crew visit six different places -- Barcelona Egypt Naples Odessa Palestine and "Hellas" (the latter could be Greece or France) -- as he confronts issues of truth versus myth and where the global community is headed.

Headstrong and full of energy 14-year-old Arrietty (voice of Bridgit Mendler) is just like any other adolescent girl -- except for the fact that she's only a few inches tall. Arrietty and her family are Borrowers: a race of tiny people who live among the regular-size humans undetected and only emerge to scrounge miniscule amounts of essential living supplies from well-stocked cupboards and cabinets. Contact with the Borrowers' normal-size counterparts is strictly forbidden but when Arrietty attempts to help her father stock up on necessities and meets 12-year-old Shawn (voice of David Henrie) the pair develop an unlikely bond. Shawn has come to live with his great aunt and should she find out about the Borrowers it would be disastrous for Arrietty and her family. But perhaps by working together Shawn and Arrietty can figure out a way for the Borrowers and humans to live together in harmony., Bridgit Mendler | Amy Poehler | Will Arnett | Carol Burnett | David Henrie | Moisés Arias, The Borrowers | The Borrowers | Story of Princess Kaguya | Bridge to Terabithia | Where the Wild Things Are | Ratatouille

Pablo Escobar was not related to Andrés but they came to know each other well -- Pablo owned the team Andrés played for and bankrolled the recruiting drive that helped make them one of the world's best. But while Andrés was seen as a hero Pablo made his money as a large-scale drug trafficker and he got involved in professional soccer because he loved the game but also needed to launder his ill-gotten fortune into a legitimate business. Pablo created an image for himself as a Colombian Robin Hood opening clinics creating low-cost housing and building soccer fields for the poor but he and his henchmen were willing to use violence to achieve their ends and when Andrés fumbled an important game during the 1994 World Cup games he learned a painful lesson about loyalty among Escobar's underlings. Filmmakers Jeff Zimbalist and Michael Zimbalist share the remarkable true story of two very different men whose love of a game brought them to good and bad ends in the documentary The Two Escobars.

But in a couple of historical instances the Norwegian army engaged in acts of controversial brutality by opening fire on innocent locals. This sweeping epic drama from director Marius Holst recreates one such tragedy. The year is 1915; the place is a remote fjord just outside of Oslo where an institution called the Bastoy Boys' Home is situated. Functioning as both a residence for youths from dysfunctional or impoverished homes and a reform school it is guilty of routine acts of sadistic brutality meted out for even the most inconsequential of crimes such as pilfering money from a church collection plate. It also operates according to a warped and twisted deviation of evangelical Christianity that involves viscerally abusing young charges into becoming faithful believers. Perhaps most unbearable is the atmosphere of extreme dehumanization: Administrators rob the boys of their names and tag them with arbitrary numbers. As the story opens a newcomer arrives -- a whaler named Erling (Benjamin Helstad) who is alleged to have committed homicide. In no time at all he stirs up trouble wherever he goes as he does battle with the school governor (Stellan Skarsgard) confronts the sexually abusive dorm master (Kristoffer Joner) and expands the horizons of sincere but troubled dorm leader Olav (Trond Nilssen). Before long Erling drums up the spirit of revolution in the school hallways. Many of the boys are delighted to find a courageous leader who will help them stand up to injustice but no one can anticipate the punishment that the government has in store for the hell-raisers., Kristoffer Joner | Benjamin Helstad | Trond Nilssen | Ellen Dorrit Petersen | Magnus Langlete, The Chocolate War | Taps | The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys | The Godfather | Patton | Spartacus

However when Topolski tried to upload some rare recordings of barbershop quartets to a peer-to-peer file sharing website in 2007 he found that his broadband Internet connection slowed down to a tiny fraction of its usual speed. Topolski who worked as a computer network engineer ran some tests to find out what was happening and made a surprising discovery -- his Internet service provider was monitoring the web use of its customers and using software to slow connections for certain activities and certain websites. Topolski took his ISP to court and has become a passionate spokesman for Net Neutrality believing that ISP's have no right to interfere with what their customers are doing and should not be watching their online activities. Topolski's case is one of the key inspirations behind the documentary Barbershop Punk which explores how a small number of powerful corporations have the power to control the world wide web and what ordinary people can do to promote the free exchange of information in cyberspace.

The son of a wealthy businessman Abramoff became a Republican activist in college involved in programs to raise funds for GOP candidates and supporting political movements in Angola and South Africa that he believed promoted a free-market ideology. In 2001 Abramoff took control of a profitable gaming empire after the murder of casino owner Gus Boulis while also operating a lobbying business that curried political favor among Republican politicians through money and expensive gifts (one of his leading allies was GOP party whip Tom DeLay). However when Abramoff was discovered to have defrauded a number of Native American groups hoping to open gambling casinos with promises of political favors that could be obtained for the right price his empire came crashing to the ground taking a number of important reputations along with it. Filmmaker Alex Gibney chronicles the rise and fall of Jack Abramoff and the often bizarre story of how his political and financial ambitions took root in the documentary Casino Jack and the United States of Money which includes interviews with a number of his associates and rare newsreel footage of his early years as a political gadfly.

And what would happen if the wrong people got their hands on the bomb -- or if some of the "good" people were to detonate one through error or mistaken judgment?

Over the course of the next three days gay protestors clashed with police in an uprising that made headlines across the world.

Paula was taken to the hospital and convinced that she was dying Paula made a startling statement to the doctor -- that for years her father Elijah Colvard Jr. had been sexually abusing her as well as her sisters Angelika and Chica. Paula survived but Elijah was in time found guilty of child sexual abuse and spent a year in prison. Chico hadn't had any contact with his father for many years when he discovered that Elijah was invited to a family reunion he would be attending. While Chico expected the event would give everyone an opportunity to confront the father about his crimes the reality was quite different as Elijah seemed content to act as if he'd done nothing wrong and his sisters were similarly able to ignore their father's betrayal. Chico brought a small video camera to the reunion and the footage he shot that day became part of his documentary Family Affair in which he examines a shocking and tragic real-life story of abuse and its emotional consequences.

We see the statistics every day -- students dropping out science and math scores falling and schools closing due to lack of funding. What we don't see are the names and faces of the children whose entire futures are at stake due to our own inability to enact change. There was a time when the American public education system was a model admired by the entire world. Today other countries are surpassing us in every respect and the slogan "No Child Left Behind" has become a cynical punch line. Bianca Emily Anthony Daisy and Francisco are five students who deserve better. By investigating how the current system is actually obstructing their education instead of bolstering it Guggenheim opens the door to considering possible options for transformation and improvement., Geoffrey Canada, American Teacher | I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary School | High School II | The Cartel | The War on Kids | An Inconvenient Truth

Merritt's own expressive but froggy vocals are at once an ideal vehicle for his lyrics and one of the reasons his music appeals to a discriminating cult but hasn't broken through to the mass audience. Filmmakers Kerthy Fix and Gail O'Hara spent ten years sporadically following Merritt with their cameras and Strange Powers: Stephin Merritt and the Magnetic Fields is the result a documentary about his music and the man who lurks behind it.

A onetime Baghdad bureau chief of the Washington Post Chandrasekaran was present as American forces attempted to set up a provisional government on the grounds surrounding former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's opulent palace. The resulting governing body according to critics existed in a bubble so far-removed from the grim realities of the Iraq War that it failed to properly assess the needs of the people. In this fictional thriller set during the U.S.-led occupation of Baghdad director Greengrass and screenwriter Brian Helgeland use Chandrasekaran's journalistic account as the foundation for the story of an officer who joins forces with a senior CIA officer to unearth evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) is certain that Hussein has been stockpiling WMDs in the Iraqi desert but in their race from one empty site to the next they soon stumble across evidence of an elaborate cover up. As a result Miller realizes that operatives on both sides of the conflict are attempting to spin the story in their favor. Now as Miller searches for answers made ever more elusive by covert and faulty intelligence the truth becomes the most valuable weapon of all. Will those answers prove pivotal in clearing a rogue regime or escalate the war in a region that grows increasingly unstable with each passing day? Amy Ryan co-stars as the New York Times foreign correspondent who travels to Iraq investigating the U.S. government's allegations about weapons of mass destruction with Greg Kinnear appearing in the role of an additional CIA officer and Antoni Corone essaying the role of a colonel.

The story opens with physician Anton (Mikael Persbrandt working abroad in a Kenyan hospital where he's routinely treating female victims of a psychotic thug known as Big Man (Evans Muthini). Anton himself suffers from a dysfunctional home life given his emotional estrangement from his wife (Trine Dyrholm) and his desire to set a positive example for son Elias (Markus Rygaard) -- the physician longs to mend both relationships but finds this difficult given his frequent absenteeism. Meanwhile another family suffers from equally grave issues: Claus (Ulrich Thomsen) and his son Christian (William Jøhnk Juels Nielsen) move from London back to their home country of Denmark; Claus is still reeling from his late wife's recent death from cancer and father and son find it more and more difficult to connect with another. But Christian has much deeper issues than simple filial alienation -- an almost pathological addiction to retribution that manifests itself in a knife-wielding attempt to protect new friend Elias from a local bully. Elias and Christian become fast companions but as they do it draws out a level of rage in both boys that threatens to culminate in shocking terroristic levels of violence., Mikael Persbrandt | Trine Dyrholm | Ulrich Thomsen | Markus Rygaard | Bodil Jorgensen | Elsebeth Steentoft | Martin Buch | Kim Bodnia, After the Wedding | The Son's Room | Broken Wings | Mother | Amreeka | Submarino

At the time of the battle most of the American soldiers in North Korea were only teenagers with no concept of war and inhumanity. The lessons they learned on those snowy mountains while building parapets out of the bodies of fallen friends and battling Chinese soldiers hand to hand after their weapons failed from the cold would remain with them for life even if they were far too painful to talk about. But now decades later the members of the 1st Marine Division will tell their stories -- tales of remarkable courage in the face of overwhelming odds and unwavering allegiance to the American flag and everything it stood for., , M*A*S*H | Silent Wings: The American Glider Pilots of WWII | Always Ready: The United States Coast Guard Story | Appointment in Tokyo | Battle for Warsaw | The Turbulent End to a Tragic War: America's Final Hours in Vietnam

(VMI), , Musician's Life, heavy-metal-music musician rock-band, , Ian Fraiser Kilmister better known to the world as Lemmy Kilmister is arguably the single most indefatigable character in the history of rock & roll. Born in 1945 Lemmy played in a handful of small-time British acts before joining the pioneering "space rock" band Hawkwind in 1971 and sang lead on their best-known song "Silver Machine." But it was when Lemmy formed Motörhead in 1975 that he took his first steps toward becoming a living legend. Motörhead played heavy metal faster and louder than anyone dared in the mid-'70s and their relentless aural assault fueled by Lemmy's bruising staccato bass lines and howling leather-lunged vocals ushered in a new era of metal and was a key influence on Metallica Anthrax Slayer and literally hundreds of other bands in heavy metal and punk. While Motörhead's albums have never enjoyed consistent success on the charts the band has continued to tour tirelessly and well into his sixties Lemmy plays and lives as hard as he ever has rocking head-banging audiences around the world as he survives on a diet of red meat bourbon and cigarettes.

Like most high school kids Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) just wants to be popular. So much so than when her best friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) asks Olive how her weekend went the bored teen decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes) and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery.

As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's (Dan Byrd) popularity a much-needed shot in the arm.

But such is the situation that around 1.4 million Israeli citizens of Arabic ethnic origin are facing -- continually struggling to maintain their cultural identities despite pressure to conform or blend in. One area in which cultural assertion continues to take place is on the soccer field; Israelis are overwhelmingly passionate about the game and it's a noteworthy fact that an Arabic league called Bnei Sakhnin (also known as the Sons of Sakhnin United) won the prestigious Israeli Cup in 2004. This victory -- even more than the existence of the team per se -- soon came to represent a potential bridge of peace between Hebrew and Palestinian cultures. As directed by Christopher Browne the documentary After the Cup: Sons of Sakhnin United observes the Sakhnin team in the season immediately following the pivotal win amid the realization that this season may be their final one in the public spotlight. Yet the team hardly goes through the season without obstacles: they must grapple with a dearth of funding vast inexperience conflict building between the coach and star player and the sudden onslaught of pressure to transcend overwhelming public expectations.

As the family gets used to the new arrival strange noises are heard late at night and when they come home from an outing they discover the house has been trashed even though none of their valuables have been stolen. Daniel responds by installing a security system and a network of surveillance cameras though that doesn't stop the noises or the Latino housekeeper's insistence that spirits lurk in the home. When Katie and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) stop by for a visit they discuss the strange goings-on with Kristi; the women of the house believe supernatural forces are at work while the men find that notion ridiculous.

https://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-spy-next-door-v466795, The Spy Next Door, Comedy, Action Comedy, Jan 15 2010, 92, USA, PG, 6,  Scatological Humor, Brian Levant, Relativity Media Robert Simonds Company, Lionsgate, Just for Fun, Nannies and Caregivers, family gadgets martial-arts spy teenagers, , Reminiscent of Kindergarten Cop with a dash of Spy Kids The Spy Next Door blends together an entertaining mixture of family fun and martial-arts comedy styling to form a familiar story that once again reminds us that even hardened action heroes have a soft side. Jackie Chan stars as Bob Ho an international spy on loan to the CIA who gives up his job in hopes of leading a so-called normal life with his next-door-neighbor girlfriend and her rambunctious brood. There's nothing in Spy that the audience hasn't seen before from similarly themed incarnations (think The Pacifier) but fans will appreciate director Brian Levant's homage to Jackie Chan's past Hong Kong movie blockbusters -- most notably Police Story and The Legend of Drunken Master -- during the opening credit sequence which is fitting considering many of the action sequences are derivative of those films. The main story centers on Bob's relationship with artsy single mom Gillian (Amber Valletta) and her three kids: precocious teenage stepdaughter Farren (Madeline Carroll) nerdy middle child Ian (Will Shadley) and adorably energetic Nora (Alina Foley). After an emergency sends Gillian away to Denver Bob steps up and offers to watch the kids while she's gone. Ill-equipped to handle a situation that's clearly over his head Bob utilizes his spy skills and gadgets -- video watch GPS tracking x-ray glasses -- to gain control over the situation in hopes of winning over the kid's affection but when an old enemy escapes from prison and threatens his potential family Bob must return to his 007 world of international espionage to protect them. Admittedly there's a certain level of cheese in this film especially when it comes to the Boris-and-Natasha-style villains Poldark (Magnús Scheving) and Creel (Katherine Boecher) whose silly Russian stereotyped performances and running joke about American fashion unabashedly border on cringe-worthy territory. Not to mention the thinly plotted storyline involving brainiac Ian who accidentally downloads a top-secret formula for oil-eating ooze created by the bad guys which propels the main action of the film. Adding to the pile are the supporting cast members: George Lopez as the traitorous CIA agent Glaze and Billy Ray Cyrus as CIA agent and Bob's BFF Colton James who lends folksy witticisms like "As gone as rum cake at an AA meeting." Even so Chan's charm wins out in the end and The Spy Next Door's most effective sequences involve Bob's attempts to bond with the kids -- from taking little Nora shopping for a Halloween costume to helping Ian with school bullies and girls. These comedic moments more or less overshadow an otherwise simplistic narrative and the audience can't help but smile to themselves every time Chan appears onscreen. Die-hard fans might miss the era of classic kick-ass Hong Kong action films but Spy manages to fill that void as an entertaining alternative that kids and parents alike will enjoy., Jackie Chan | Amber Valletta | Madeline Carroll | George Lopez | Billy Ray Cyrus | Katherine Boecher | Lucas Till | Mia Stallard | Quinn Mason | Frank Bond | Arron Shiver | Esodie Geiger | Stephen Eiland | Tim Connolly | Jeff Chase | Mark Kubr | David Mattey, The Pacifier | Kindergarten Cop | The Accidental Spy | Get Smart | Suburban Commando | Mr. Nanny

https://www.allmovie.com/movie/winston-churchill-walking-with-destiny-v524213, Winston Churchill: Walking With Destiny, History, Biography, Oct 29 2010, 101, , , 6, , Richard Trank, , Moriah Films, Food for Thought, Heads of State, government political-leader Prime-Minister retrospective, , Richard Trank's biographical film focuses on the 20 months between Churchill's ascent to prime minister and the American entry into the Second World War at the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942. But to do that it must first carry us back to 1930 when Winston Churchill was at the low point of a three-decade political career; still holding a seat in Parliament but out of the government and also out of favor with the leadership of the British Conservative Party he was in isolation -- political social and personal -- for much of the decade that followed. In the intervening years he wrote and spoke with ever-increasing fervor against the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany a lone voice in a complacent or oblivious world. Eventually he was brought back into the government begrudgingly by the Conservative Party leadership as First Lord of the Admiralty. And after a decade in isolation he became the reluctant choice of both King George VI and the outgoing prime minister Neville Chamberlain to succeed the latter. Combining his writing ability -- perhaps the most formidable of anyone in government anywhere in the English-speaking world -- and his best moral and political instincts and one of the best speaking voices in the public life of the era Churchill became an inspiring figure both at home and abroad over the ensuing 18 months. Coupled with the near-miraculous success of the evacuation of British and French forces from Dunkirk in the wake of the military disaster in France his presence became a rallying point for anti-Nazis on both sides of the Atlantic helping to turn the isolationist tide in American politics amid the turmoil of Franklin Roosevelt's unprecedented run for a third presidential term. All the while Churchill was also facing daily new threats from an emboldened Germany now based directly across the English Channel and presumed to be planning an imminent invasion. Trank's movie bound together with narration by Sir Ben Kingsley weaves these and many other threads -- including an oddly understated yet suitably relevant one regarding Churchill's connection to Jews in England -- together in a focused account of those 20 treacherous months and the results are engrossing even to those familiar with most of the material covered., , Biography: Thurgood Marshall - Justice for All | Biography: John and Abigail Adams | William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe | Harlan County USA | The Fog of War | Salvador Allende

As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son.

Though Kalle Thomas and Johanna thought they were pursuing a criminal after locating Hans (Otto Jespersen) with the help of some local hunters they learn that bears are not his true target but a mere smokescreen to obscure what he's really after -- trolls. A secret government agency has been conspiring to cover up the existence of these massive monsters but occasionally the trolls manage to break their containment area. When that happens it falls on Hans to capture the creatures at all costs. Trolls are highly sensitive to sunlight and traditional weapons only make them angry. Instead of carrying a gun Hans carries an enormous UV light capable of stopping even the fiercest of trolls dead in its tracks. The only way that humans can travel in the area undetected is to cover their bodies in a foul-smelling concoction that makes them invisible to the troll's highly developed sense of smell. Lately the long hours and grueling work conditions have been taking their toll on Hans so when the student filmmakers show up looking for a good story he decides that it's time for the truth to come out no matter what the cost.

The documentary's focus is French-born L.A. thrift-shop owner Thierry Guetta whose apparent compulsion to videotape every moment of his life led him to document the phenomenon of contemporary street art. Guetta's cousin a street artist known as Space Invader allowed the avid cameraman to tape him as he illegally spread his artwork and Space Invader also introduced him to other street artists whose work Guetta captured on tape. Eventually Guetta hooked up with Shepard Fairey who was best known (before he created an iconic Barack Obama campaign poster) for his widespread stickers featuring an image of the late wrestler Andre the Giant over the word "OBEY." Guetta soon hears about the mysterious street artist/prankster Banksy and becomes obsessed with finding him and videotaping his exploits. Thanks to Guettta's growing reputation among street artists the two eventually meet and form a sort of partnership. Guetta even videotapes Banksy's infamous "Gitmo" prank at Disneyland wherein a handcuffed hooded figure in an orange jumpsuit is placed beside one of the rides. They get along quite well until Banksy suggests that Guetta stop shooting take the countless hours of footage he's accumulated and start assembling them into a documentary. Banksy eventually takes over the documentary project and inadvertently pushes Guetta's creative energy in a new direction as Guetta becomes a kind of street artist himself with shocking results. Exit Through the Gift Shop narrated by Rhys Ifans had its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. While it was very well received there was much speculation as to the documentary's veracity and the provenance of Guetta his videotape and his artwork.

Courtney was a businessman and football fan who took it upon himself to do something about the Manassas football program; he volunteered his services as coach and began shaping a hapless team into one with genuine prospects. Filmmakers Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin followed Courtney and his players through the 2009 season and their documentary Undefeated examines the coach's efforts to give the school a winning record as well as the sometimes complex relationship between Courtney a white wealthy businessman and his players who are all black and mostly come from communities stuck in a cycle of poverty and crime.

Back in the 1970s Dr. Burzynski discovered antineoplastons a gene-targeted cancer treatment that has helped millions afflicted with the most deadly forms of the disease. Previously able to develop and administer antineoplaston treatment in Texas -- where physicians were not required to follow Federal law -- Dr. Burzynski successfully treated various so-called "incurable" cancers before the Food and Drug Administration made it their personal mission to shut him down. In addition to covering the ten years of trials that the Food and Drug Administration forced Dr. Burzynski to endure Merola also explores the reasons why the U.S. government was so intent on halting a cancer treatment that showed real results. Could the fact that pharmaceutical giants won't see a penny of profit from antineoplastons have anything to do with the fact that the powers that be seem intent on keeping this life-saving treatment from the public?, , Pink Ribbons Inc. | Lorenzo's Oil | Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders | Sicko | Sing Your Song | A Mother's Courage: Talking Back to Autism

Christine (Scott-Thomas) is the head executive at a top agribusiness firm in France. Ruthless and uncompromising she revels in playing diabolical head-games with her staffers that include blackmail and seduction and enjoys an almost pathologically close relationship with protégé Isabelle (Sagnier). The women also share a lover accountant Philippe (Patrick Mille) who readily assumes a submissive role to the dominatrix posturing of each lady in the bedroom. The balance of power shifts however when a colleague (Guillaume Marquet) shows Isabelle how to "one-up" Christine in the office - which prompts Christine to respond with a nasty humiliating trick involving a security camera. In the days ahead retaliation escalates on both ends until each of the women begins contemplating felonious action against the other. To reveal more would be unfair but suffice it to say that Corneau packs the narrative with a series of unforeseeable twists and turns.

Hall) whose career as an architect is crumbling almost as quickly as his marriage to Laura (Judy Greer). When the family gathers to celebrate the 70th birthday of their father (Ron Rifkin) along with their mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and her new husband (Nicholas Hormann) it makes for an evening with explosive potential.

In late December 1994 an airliner took off from Algeria bound for Paris but once the plane was in the air it became clear this would not be an ordinary flight. Members of the Algerian Armed Islamic Group led by Yahia (Aymen Saidi) were onboard and they took over the jet in order to stage an attack on the Eiffel Tower. Negotiators were able to arrange for the plane to land in Marseille for fuel and the hijackers were met by French Special Forces operatives who were determined to save the hostages and take down the terrorists. L'Assaut (aka The Assault) examines the hijacking and the raid on the jet from three perspectives -- Yahia Thierry (Vincent Elbaz) one of the policemen taking part in the raid and Carole (Mélanie Bernier) a low-level Ministry of the Interior employee who believes her language skills will give her a chance to shine in the crisis.

As she was growing up Costa's uncle Rodolfo was always the black sheep of the family -- he was the one who never married who lived alone who wanted to be a dancer rather than a laborer and who wore clothes his brothers thought were inappropriate. It wasn't until Costa became an adult that she realized Rodolfo was gay and when he was found dead in his home she began to imagine how Paraguay's oppressive attitudes towards gays and lesbians had impacted him. Under the dictatorial rule of Alfredo Stroessner gays were harassed by the authorities their arrests were publicized by the police and violence against them was commonplace and tolerated. Years later after a long exile in Spain Costa finds Paraguay is marginally more tolerant but few gays or lesbians have the courage to express their sexuality in a place where they're still encouraged to remain in the closet. Costa's film Cuchillo de Palo (aka 108) takes its name from a derogatory name for gays still used in Paraguay and tells the story of her uncle's life and death while also examining how little circumstances have improved for Paraguay's gay community in the 21st Century. 108 was an official selection at the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival., , American Experience: The Pill | This Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous | Changing Our Minds: The Story of Dr. Evelyn Hooker | Paris Is Burning | The Hidden Führer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality | Top Secret Rosies: The Female Computers of World War II

But a few things held them back -- their music was a crazy quilt of funk ska punk hard rock and R&B that was exciting but wildly difficult to classify and all the group's members were black which shouldn't have mattered but did as radio and MTV became increasingly segregated in the 1980s. The group was spawned by a typically 1970s cultural collision; founding member Norwood Fisher became part of a court-ordered bussing program that took him out of South Central Los Angeles to a school in the San Fernando Valley where he met fellow outcast Angelo Moore. Together Fisher and Moore took their own musical ideas rooted in reggae and funk mixed them with the rock and punk favored by their classmates and created a sound that was all their own. But for all their promise and talent Fishbone had a way of generating chaos and the frequent conflicts between band members (best exemplified by their attempts to liberate Walter Kibby after he joined a cult) certainly didn't help matters. Filmmakers Lev Anderson and Chris Metzler chronicle the band's long strange history in the documentary Everyday Sunshine: The Story Of Fishbone which includes interviews with noted fans Gwen Stefani Flea Ice-T George Clinton Mike Watt Branford Marsalis and Tim Robbins.

Filmmakers Reed Cowan and Steven Greenstreet examine the role of the Mormon Church in the battle against same-sex marriage in the documentary 8: The Mormon Proposition as well as examining Mormon doctrine on homosexuality (including church-approved programs to "cure" homosexuality) suicide rates among gay teens in Mormon communities and misleading comments from Mormon leaders on the impact of Prop. 8 on religious freedoms. 8: The Mormon Proposition received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival., Dustin Lance Black | Dennis Herrera | Carol Lynn Pearson | Emily Pearson | Gavin Newsom | Rocky Anderson, God Loves Uganda | God and Gays: Bridging the Gap | Lake of Fire | Good Night and Good Luck.

Over six killers have been convicted and sentenced to death based on her assertions though Cara has remained firm in her beliefs both about science and about God. All of those beliefs are shaken to the core however when her own husband is murdered and her father introduces her to his own most challenging patient a troubled young man named Adam -- who would seem to suffer from multiple personalities each of which are the identities of murder victims. Soon Cara is in a race against time to discover whether all her convictions have really been called into question or if she is merely a pawn in a psychotic deadly game., Julianne Moore | Jonathan Rhys-Meyers | Jeffrey DeMunn | Frances Conroy | Brooklyn Proulx, Carrie | Case 39 | In Dreams | Silent Hill | The Ward | The New Daughter

The growing phenomenon of the sport of mixed-martial arts (MMA) takes this notion adds the showmanship of professional wrestling and encourages would-be contestants by declaring that anyone with the strength and the nerve can step into the cage regardless of their training and chosen style (or their lack thereof).

In Fightville we meet Dustin "The Diamond" Poirier who came from an abusive upbringing first injured someone in a fight at the age of five and has the anger and determination to take (and dole out) punishment in the ring on a regular basis. We're also introduced to Albert Stainback a smart and talented fighter with a good eye towards conjuring an image but not the same athletic skillset and Gil "The Thrill" Guillory an MMA promoter with an eye for talent and no use for starry-eyed would-be fighters who can't give the crowd what they want and bring in return customers.

While gay men had enjoyed greater freedom in New Orleans than in most American cities homophobic violence was hardly unknown there and police harassment at gay clubs was common especially close to Mardi Gras when known drag queens would often find themselves arrested on trumped-up charges that would force them to cut their hair before their public appearances. In the early 1960s a group of gay men tired of public abuse formed their own Mardi Gras "krewe" a group that would stage parties and parades to celebrate the holiday. While several all-make krewes had staged private drag events this group chose to make their celebrations public and while their 1962 ball was the subject of a major police raid within a few years the city government officially recognized the gay krewes and four were officially sanctioned by 1969. Filmmaker Tim Wolff explores the tradition of drag balls and gay krewes in New Orleans in the documentary The Sons of Tennessee Williams which includes extensive interviews with men who witnessed this history first hand and discuss how the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 impacted the Crescent City.
