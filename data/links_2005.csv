In 1959 Truman Capote (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason the story fascinated Capote and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban) his editor at The New Yorker to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction and he believed this event in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death and the way that he would be remembered. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy and Amy Ryan as Mary Dewey Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's., Philip Seymour Hoffman | Catherine Keener | Clifton Collins Jr. | Chris Cooper | Bruce Greenwood | Bob Balaban | Amy Ryan | Mark Pellegrino | C.

In the early 1930s Carl Denham (Jack Black) is a daring filmmaker and adventurer who has gained a reputation for his pictures documenting wildlife in remote and dangerous jungle lands; despite the objections of his backers Denham plans to film his next project aboard an ocean vessel en route to Skull Island an uncharted island he discovered on a rare map. Correctly assuming his cast and crew would be wary of such a journey Denham has told them they're traveling to Singapore but before they set sail his leading lady drops out of the project. Needing a beautiful actress willing to take a risk Denham finds Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a beautiful but down-on-her-luck vaudeville performer and offers her the role; cautious but eager to work Darrow takes the role and onboard the ship she strikes up a romance with Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) a respected playwright hired by Denham to write the script for his latest epic. When Denham and company arrive on Skull Island the natives react with savage violence but they happen to be the least of their worries. Skull Island is a sanctuary for prehistoric life and lording it over the dinosaurs and other giant beasts is Kong a 25-foot-tall gorilla who can outfight any creature on Earth. The natives kidnap Darrow giving her to Kong as an offering to appease the giant beast; Denham and his men set out to find her with Driscoll bravely determined to save the woman he loves. Eventually Driscoll finds Darrow and Denham outwits Kong intending to take the giant ape back to New York for display. But Kong has bonded with Darrow and his attraction to her proves to be his undoing.

In the 1920s James Braddock (Russell Crowe) from Bergen NJ was a promising contender in professional boxing; he had strength spirit and tenacity but the combination of a serious hand injury and a 1929 defeat in a bout with light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran sent his career into a serious tailspin. As Braddock's career in the ring dried up the Great Depression put a stake through the heart of America's economy and Braddock found himself working at the New York docks for pitiful wages as he tried to support his wife Mae (Renée Zellweger) and three children. Desperate for money Braddock turned to his former trainer and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) who was unexpectedly able to scare up a bout for him battling John Griffin at Madison Square Garden. While conventional wisdom had it that Braddock was too old out of shape and out of practice to have any chance of winning he defeated Griffin and continued beating his opponents with a powerful left hook that had been intensified by years of punishing dock work. In a nation desperate for good news Braddock's surprising comeback became a tonic to struggling workers and unemployed people and all eyes were on Braddock when in 1935 he took on powerful heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko) in what was both literally and figuratively the fight of his life., Russell Crowe | Renée Zellweger | Paul Giamatti | Craig Bierko | Bruce McGill | Paddy Considine | Ron Canada | David Huband | Connor Price | Ariel Waller | Patrick Louis | Rosemarie DeWitt | Linda Kash | Nicholas Campbell | Alicia Johnston | Mark Simmons | Art Binkowski | Rance Howard | Angelo Dundee, Seabiscuit | Million Dollar Baby | Rocky Balboa | The Grapes of Wrath | The Great White Hope | The Champ

Murrow in this fact-based drama which was Clooney's second feature film as a director. In 1953 Edward R. Murrow (played by David Strathairn) was one of the best-known newsmen on television as host of both the talk show Person to Person and the pioneering investigate series See It Now. Joseph McCarthy a U.S. senator from Wisconsin was generating no small amount of controversy in the public and private sectors with his allegations that Communists had risen to positions of power and influence in America and an Air Force pilot Milo Radulovich had been drummed out of the service due to McCarthy's charges that he was a Communist agent. However Radulovich had been dismissed without a formal hearing of the charges and he protested that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. Murrow decided to do a story on Radulovich's case questioning the legitimacy of his dismissal which was seen by McCarthy and his supporters as an open challenge to his campaign. McCarthy responded by accusing Murrow of being a Communist leading to a legendary installment of See It Now in which both Murrow and McCarthy presented their sides of the story which was seen by many as the first step toward McCarthy's downfall. Meanwhile Murrow had to deal with CBS head William Paley (Frank Langella) who was supportive of Murrow but extremely wary of his controversial positions while Murrow was also trying to support fellow newsman Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) battling charges against his own political views and working alongside Fred Friendly (George Clooney) the daring head of CBS News.

Based in part on the writings of former CIA case officer Robert Baer Syriana combines multiple storylines to explore the complexities that befall a proposed merger between two U.S. oil giants. Reform-minded Gulf country prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) is in favor of making his nation more self-sufficient rather than U.S.-reliant and his money-minded Western connections couldn't be less pleased. Before settling into a cushy desk job for the remainder of his career CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) is sent on one last assignment -- to assassinate Prince Nasir and reinstate U.S. ties in the oil-rich region. Though his loyalty dictates that Barnes carry out his current mission despite lingering doubts of a previous blunder his mission goes horribly awry when his field contact goes turncoat and Barnes becomes a CIA scapegoat. Meanwhile up-and-coming Washington attorney Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) attempts to walk a fine line in overseeing a tenuous merger between two oil giants that's plagued with shady business dealings. Hotshot energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is in talks to form a lucrative partnership with Prince Nasir though the death of his son during a party at the prince's estate makes him question his loyalty to business over family. Back in Washington D.C. Bennet's boss Dean Whiting attempts to undermine Prince Nasir's attempts to make his country less reliant on the U.S. dollar by planting the seeds of dissonance between the progressive prince and his money-minded younger brother Prince Meshal (Akbar Kurtha)., George Clooney | Matt Damon | Jeffrey Wright | Chris Cooper | William Hurt | Tim Blake Nelson | Amanda Peet | Christopher Plummer | Alexander Siddig | Mazhar Munir | Mark Strong | Max Minghella | Fritz Michel | Akbar Kurtha | Viola Davis | William C.

Unafraid to take a risk in the venture yet lacking the experience needed to run the theater Mrs. Henderson brings in showbiz veteran Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to line up an opening act that will set the stage ablaze. When the ever-curious Mrs. Henderson's intrusive spying begins to impede on Mr. Van Damm's creative progress the frustrated theater manager has her banished from rehearsals. Though Van Damm's innovative idea to stage an unending stream of entertainment dubbed "Revudeville" proves a wild and profitable success the Windmill begins to suffer when other local theaters quickly follow suit. Now faced with the prospect of seeing her once-lucrative endeavor fall by the wayside due to the unoriginality of the copycats who surround her Mrs. Henderson decides to show audiences something they've never seen before by making the Windmill the first theater to feature nude female entertainers live on-stage., Judi Dench | Bob Hoskins | William Young | Christopher Guest | Kelly Reilly | Thelma Barlow | Anna Brewster | Rosalind Halstead | Natalia Tena | Toby Jones, Kinky Boots | Hope and Glory | The Full Monty | Potiche | The Best House in London | Being Julia

And they have to be -- each year the emperor penguins of Antarctica travel through the most punishing environment on Earth to their nesting grounds and after the females lay their eggs the males keep them warm while their mates walk 70 miles back to the sea to fatten themselves with fish for themselves and their young. Filmmaker Luc Jacquet spent over a year braving the frigid temperatures of the South Pole to film this annual ritual of the penguins and March of the Penguins documents their brave struggle to survive as well as the close emotional bonds between the penguin families. March of the Penguins was first screened in France as La marche de l'empereur with a handful of French actors providing a voice-over in which they expressed the "thoughts" of the penguins; for the American edition Morgan Freeman was brought in to deliver a more straightforward narration., Morgan Freeman, Winged Migration | Chimpanzee | African Safari | The Last Lions | Turtle: The Incredible Journey | Land of the Bears

Timothy Treadwell was a self-styled authority on bears who starting in 1990 would spend as much time as possible each year in Alaska camping out near a grizzly bear habitat. While Treadwell claimed to love the bears and felt as one with them he had no formal training in their behavior and while familiarizing himself with the creatures he would walk within a few feet of them with a video camera in hand. To many Treadwell seemed part man of nature part conjuror and part self-promotion expert but the part that guided his kinship with the bears failed him in 2003 when he and his girlfriend were killed in a grizzly attack. Treadwell shot hundreds of hours of footage of himself and the grizzlies and Herzog has used this footage as the core of Grizzly Man a documentary look at Treadwell's life and death while also including interviews with people who knew him animal experts and scientists.

Interweaving multiple storylines from the series' history this violent crime noir paints the picture of the ultimate town without pity through the eyes of its roughest characters. There's the street thug Marv (Mickey Rourke) whose desperate quest to find the killer of a prostitute named Goldie (Jaime King) will lead him to the foulest edges of town. Inhabiting many of those areas is Dwight (Clive Owen) a photographer in league with the sordid ladies of Sin City headed by Gail (Rosario Dawson) who opens up a mess of trouble after tangling with a corrupt cop by the name of Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). Finally there's Hartigan (Bruce Willis) an ex-cop with a heart problem who's hell-bent on protecting a stripper named Nancy (Jessica Alba). Featuring a who's who supporting cast that includes Elijah Wood Brittany Murphy Devon Aoki and Nick Stahl Sin City promises to be one of the most direct translations from page to screen of a comic series with shots and dialogue adapted straight from the original comic's panels. Rodriguez quit the Director's Guild when they refused to let Frank Miller co-direct the film a deal hashed out after the two collaborators developed and shot the opening scene utilizing a green-screen process to harness the stark black-and-white look of the books as a litmus test for the rest of the production. Quentin Tarantino was brought in and reportedly paid one dollar to direct an extended scene between Del Toro and Owen that amounts to one issue of The Big Fat Kill miniseries., Jessica Alba | Devon Aoki | Alexis Bledel | Powers Boothe | Rosario Dawson | Benicio Del Toro | Michael Clarke Duncan | Carla Gugino | Josh Hartnett | Rutger Hauer | Jaime King | Michael Madsen | Brittany Murphy | Clive Owen | Mickey Rourke | Nick Stahl | Bruce Willis | Elijah Wood | Marley Shelton | Frank Miller | Rick Gomez, Machete Kills | 300: Rise of an Empire | Kick-Ass 2 | The Man Who Wasn't There | The Girl From the Naked Eye | Streets of Fire

Sunflower Productions The Virginia Company, New Line Cinema, In a Minor Key, Star-Crossed Lovers | Interracial/Cross-Cultural Romance | White People Among Indians, Native-American adventurer colonies exploration New-World, High Production Values, Terrence Malick the universally acclaimed American filmmaker responsible for the key 1970s features Badlands and Days of Heaven returns for a rare directorial outing with the sweeping period piece The New World -- an epic dramatization of Pocahontas' relationships with John Smith and John Rolfe. Malick's story opens at the dawn of the 17th century just prior to the colonization of the United States -- when the North American population consisted of an interconnected series of native tribes. In April 1607 three maritime vessels approach the unfamiliar continent with 103 sailors on board. As members of the Virginia Company these adventurers carry a royal charter to mount a society on the edge of the new continent. John Smith (Colin Farrell) sits chained below one of the decks. He is a 27-year-old loose cannon who for his persistently rebellious acts has been sentenced to death by hanging as soon as the ships dock. Nevertheless Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer) acknowledges Smith's ability to aid with exploration and consents to pardon him as a result. Upon landing Smith seeks assistance from local Native American tribes with colonization but runs into the unexpected -- he falls desperately in love with Pocahontas or "Playful One" (Q'orianka Kilcher) the daughter of the omnipotent Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg). Needless to say this does not sit well with Powhatan or the rest of the tribe. Moreover the oft-bellicose Smith enters a head-to-head conflict with his fellow Britons when he finds his tempestuousness calmed by the tranquility of the new landscape as the anger and violence of his shipmates concurrently build in the face of the Native Americans. Later Smith temporarily returns to England; believing that Smith is dead Pocahontas accepts the hand of plantation owner John Rolfe in marriage (with her father's blessing) and follows Rolfe back to the old country. When Smith returns to America his intended is nowhere to be seen and the entire community teeters on the brink of a British-Indian war.

In the film's first chapter Mohammed Haithem is an 11-year-old forced to make his own way in Bagdhad after the disappearance of his parents. Mohammed earns his keep working in an auto-repair shop though he would prefer to go back to school and has developed a precocious cynicism about the presence of U.S. troops along with a fear of the ongoing battles between Sunni and Shia forces. Elsewhere the struggle of the Kurdish people of Iraq is personified in a handful of people working together on a farm where they tend crops make bricks and look to their blighted past as well as hoping for a brighter future. And the fundamentalist Shiite cabal of Moqtada Sadr is profiled as they travel from Najaf to Naseriyah promoting government based on a strict interpretation of Muslim law. As Moqtada Sadr's military cadres enforce the rule they have set down they clash with American soldiers further dividing an already polarized populace.

(She directed a couple of shorts in the interim including Ode a Super-8 film inspired by the song "Ode to Bill.") Daniel London and cult folksinger Will Oldham star in the film as two old friends who go on a camping trip to a hot springs in the Cascade mountain range of Oregon. London's Mark is the responsible one with the modest house the wife (who resents his gallivanting off) the dog (who comes along) and the baby on the way. He listens to Air America and makes all the right liberal noises. Oldham's Kurt is the free-spirit type with the untamed facial hair and the junker car that looks more lived-in than vehicular. Kurt suggests the trip and they take Mark's car. Kurt has the directions to the place and they get lost ("I think we're somewhere...in the area") and spend the night at a garbage-strewn campsite where they discuss their lives and Kurt laments the apparent dissolution of their friendship. In the morning they have breakfast in a diner and Mark apologizes to Tanya (Tanya Smith) over the phone explaining that he'll be home later than expected. In the daylight they find the hot springs and spend the afternoon quietly unwinding.

In the late '80s Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) fled her abusive husband and needed to find a way to support her two children. Aimes returned to her hometown in Minnesota and followed the lead of her old friend Glory (Frances McDormand) who had bucked tradition and found a job in the iron mines that had long provided employment for much of the community. Aimes found honest labor and a living wage working the mines but she also discovered she was working with men who were uncomfortable working with women (whose right to work in the mines had been mandated by law almost 15 years prior) and didn't care to show them much respect. However as Aimes found herself the growing target of sexist jokes and abhorrent behavior she found that many of her female co-workers were reluctant to stand beside her afraid of losing a good-paying job at a time when they were increasingly hard to find. But as a personal crisis became a public war of words Aimes became the center of a nationwide controversy when she attempted to file a class action sexual harassment suit against the mine owners which put her and her family in a position of scrutiny beyond her worst expectations.

Like Sunrise Warm Springs uses as its starting point the year 1921 when the 39-year-old Roosevelt was permanently paralyzed from the waist down by an attack of polio. But whereas the earlier film concentrated on FDR's battle to return to public life despite his handicap this film zeroes in on Roosevelt's efforts to cure himself of his affliction. Having heard of the therapeutic value of the waters of Warm Springs in rural Georgia Roosevelt makes a pilgrimage to the area which is little more than a swamp surrounded by dilapidated shacks. Though he never experiences the "miracle" cure that he so desperately seeks Roosevelt is instrumental in the conversion of Warm Springs from a backwater hellhole to a streamlined efficiently managed polio-treatment center a virtual mecca for hundreds of thousands of others who had been crippled by the debilitating illness. And in the process he also brings hope optimism and racial enlightenment to the poverty-stricken multiethnic citizens of Warm Springs. Even more significantly FDR removes the stigma of polio from the public consciousness forever abolishing the misguided notions that the disease adversely affected the brain that it could be spread merely by physical contact or that it represented celestial "punishment" of the victim (it is noted however that Roosevelt was always careful never to reveal the true extent of his immobility nor his atrophied legs in public feeling that it might diminish the nation's image of an "invulnerable" Commander in Chief). Also in the cast are Cynthia Nixon as Roosevelt's devoted wife Eleanor; Jane Alexander (who'd previously played Eleanor Roosevelt in two TV miniseries) as his over-protective mother Sara; David Paymer as his crusty chief aide Louis Howe; Kathy Bates as his no-nonsense physical therapist Helena Mahoney; and Tim Blake Nelson as Tom Loyless the man in charge of Warm Springs.

Laurence Sterne's 18th century novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy Gentleman told the story of its priggish title character from the moment of conception onward with a bevy of digressions distractions and unfinished anecdotes. In adapting the work for the screen director Michael Winterbottom chose to stay true to its anarchic spirit: the film begins as a mostly straightforward adaptation of events in Sterne's writings and then veers into a tale about the making of the film itself. Steve Coogan plays Tristram Shandy who narrates his own life story beginning with his slightly botched birth overseen by an addled doctor (Dylan Moran) and his reticent father Walter (also played by Coogan). Constantly quarreling with his battle-scarred brother Toby (Rob Brydon) Walter Shandy has an epiphany when he holds his newborn son; however before that moment can occur the film switches into the present day where Coogan and Brydon playing themselves bicker over costuming and the size of their roles in the film. The rest of the film's crew has their own concerns. Director Mark (Jeremy Northam) is trying to figure out how to secure a big Hollywood star for a supporting role and shoot a battle scene on a budget. The film's brainy production assistant Jennie (Naomie Harris) worries that their adaptation is leaving out the best parts of the book as she nurses a crush on one of the cast members. All the while Coogan tries to deflect a tabloid reporter's inquiry into his strip-club escapades and attempts to pacify the concerns of his wife Jenny (Kelly MacDonald).

As the weeks wore on Olds and Scott found that a number of the soldiers whom they were "embedded" with were having serious doubts about their mission; while many were still firmly committed to the U.S. military effort others began wondering out loud what purpose their presence served and if they were accomplishing any good at all. The American soldiers were also uneasy with their status as peacekeepers when they were trained to be warriors a point that became moot when tensions in Fallujah erupted into violence over a year after "major combat operations" had supposedly come to an end in Iraq. Occupation: Dreamland is a documentary drawn from the footage Olds and Scott shot while in Iraq and attempts to paint a picture of the larger conflict in Iraq as well as the lives of the men who serve there.

Based on the short story The Return by Joseph Conrad the film opens with Jean (Pascal Greggory) extolling the virtues of his pretty wife Gabrielle (Isabelle Huppert) in voice-over as he makes his way home from work. Jean and his wife with help from their team of servants have fostered the illusion of a perfect bourgeois household. Jean is particularly happy with the way Gabrielle presents herself at the couple's frequent dinner gatherings attended by their "set" whom as he describes them "fear emotion and failure more than war." We see glimpses of these occasions in flashback while Jean explains of his wife "I'm proud of what she is -- impassive." The secure little world he's fashioned for himself is shattered when he arrives home and finds a note from Gabrielle explaining that she's leaving him. "It's terrible and right" the missive states. After a brief explosion of rage Jean tries to compose himself but he's thrown into chaos again when Gabrielle unexpectedly returns home. She finds it impossible to speak to Jean. "This letter is not the worst of it?" he asks her. "The worst is my coming back" she explains. The two struggle bitterly to regain the balance in their relationship. Soon in the interest of appearances another dinner party is planned. Gabrielle switches from black-and-white to color and back from scene to scene and is also notable for its intriguing use of intertitles.

Suddenly the image of the grinning cat was embraced by anti-war activists who attached it to the slogan "Make cats not war!"

The film's title Our Brand Is Crisis comes from the consultants' efforts to sell the voters of Bolivia on the idea that the country faced an imminent economic and political crisis and needed to turn to the experienced hand of their candidate Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada affectionately known as "Goni." Goni had been president in the 1990s and had overseen a type of privatization of Bolivia's economy (including a large natural gas reserve) known as "Capitalization" through which a large percentage of the national companies were sold to private interests with some of the money going toward social security and health-care plans. With Goni lagging in the polls GCS whose most recognizable public face is James Carville is shown conducting focus groups and strategy meetings. It becomes clear that Bolivians see his presidency as a failure because they feel he sold out their interests and failed to produce the jobs that he promised Capitalization would bring. Goni's campaign eventually "goes negative" trying to draw suspicion to the leading candidate Manfred Reyes Villa because of his wealth and his military background. The negative campaigning works to a degree but it also makes a more formidable candidate of the left-leaning Evo Morales a former leader of the coca growers union whose campaign also gets a shot in the arm from a smear from the U.S. ambassador.

Born in a small town in Connecticut Ralph Nader was raised to believe the words of his father that "you can fight city hall" and Nader made a nationwide reputation for his willingness to take on the wealthy and powerful. After receiving a degree from Harvard Law School Nader first became a household name in 1965 with his book Unsafe at Any Speed in which he detailed the auto industry's willingness to sacrifice safety in the name of greater profits. The book so outraged General Motors that they hired investigators to dig up dirt on Nader and make trouble for him; the plan backfired when Nader sued for invasion of privacy and walked away with a 425000-dollar settlement that he used to set up an activist group to investigate both public servants and private commerce and how they live up to their responsibilities. However Nader's long career as a incorruptible watchdog was tarnished in 2004 when Nader ran for president in a campaign that attracted a great deal of attention for a third party candidate -- and was blamed by many Democrats for drawing enough votes away from Al Gore to allow George W. Bush to walk away with an extremely narrow victory.

Basilio Vargas is a 14-year-old boy living in the impoverished Cerro Rico region of Bolivia. Since the death of his father Basilio and his younger brother Bernardino are the breadwinners in his family and they support their mother and siblings working in the Cerro Rico silver mines. Basilio is one of 800 children who regularly work the mines and it's indicative of the danger and physically punishing nature of the work that the miners swear fealty to "Tio" -- the Devil -- because it's believed God would never enter such a place. Cerro Rico's silver miners have an average life expectancy of 40 years or less thanks to the poisoned air the constant heat the use of explosives the primitive and unsafe equipment and the long hours demanded of the laborers (most are sent into the mines for 24-hour shifts and both children and adults often chew coca leaves to ward off hunger and fatigue). While Basilio's more fortunate classmates make fun of him when he's able to attend school he realized his family need the money and he's willing to endure the agony for the small wage he makes every day. The Devil's Miner chronicles several days in the life of Basilio Vargas as a document of the inhuman conditions he and his fellow miners face as well as the young man's bravery., , Sub Terra | Matewan | Girlhood | I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary School | Stevie | Black Picket Fence

In 1994 Joe Connor (Hugh Dancy) is a British schoolteacher who has volunteered to spend a year at the École Technique Officielle a school in the Rwandan capital of Kigali. Connor's arrival in Rwanda occurs after the nation's Civil War between the Tutsis and the Hutus has dissipated (c. August 1993). Yet despite the official end of this well-publicized struggle political negotiations between the two groups have reached a stalemate and the Hutus begin systematic preparation for a mass-genocide of the Tutsi people (who have assumed political power via the establishment of the RPF). Connor has already seen signs of the coming conflict in the abuse meted out to Marie (Claire-Hope Ashitey) a Tutsi student who was one of his star pupils as well as the bitter hatred expressed by François (David Gyasi) a Hutu janitor at the school. As the genocide erupts with extreme Hutu factions slaughtering Tutsis by the thousands the École Technique becomes a base of operations for Belgian peacekeeping forces from the United Nations. Most extended visitors from the West (especially America and Europe) flee Rwanda as the fighting breaks out but Connor decides to stay and in fact strikes up a friendship with Father Christopher (John Hurt) a Catholic priest who has come to the nation as a missionary. As Father Christopher serves mass and strives to offer solace to the Tutsis and moderate Hutus caught in the fighting he and Connor use the school as a safe haven for Tutsi refugees; however after five days of genocidal killing the U.N. troops move out leaving little hope for the people they were supposed to protect. Beyond the Gates was produced by David Belton who helped write the film's story; Belton was a correspondent with the BBC who was assigned to Rwanda when the fighting broke out., John Hurt | Hugh Dancy | Claire-Hope Ashitey | Dominique Horwitz | Louis Mahoney | Nicola Walker | Steve Toussaint | David Gyasi | Susan Nalwoga | Victor Power | Jack Pierce | Kizito Ssentamu Kayiira, Hotel Rwanda | Machine Gun Preacher | 5 Days of War | Shake Hands With the Devil | Blood Diamond | Enemies of the People

Six years later Mai and her family have settled in Northern California where they've begun a new life -- one that an older Lai (now played by Nguyen Thai Nguyen) finds profoundly difficult to accept.

In the 1950s Roth was a hot-rodder who moved from bodywork and helping guys fine-tune the look of their jalopies to building unique custom machines. Roth threw out the rule book of conventional automotive design and created fantastic visions of chrome fiberglass and supercharged engines that took one of America's most conventional consumer items and turned it into a freaked-out vision of post-adolescent cool. Roth was also a gifted cartoonist and along with his cars he also created freaked-out automotive cartoons that made the artwork in Mad Magazine look sedate; his trademark character was Rat Fink a maniacal grinning rodent who was usually seen popping the clutch behind the wheel of one of Roth's outlandish cars. Between Roth's crazed automobiles which drew thousands of fans to auto shows; the reproductions of them (in the form of model kits) which sold in the millions; and the Rat Fink and Monster T-shirts (which are still on the market today) Roth was one of the most influential figures in popular culture in the 1960s and Tales of the Rat Fink is a documentary by Ron Mann that features interviews with Roth's friends and fans as well as animated sequences that bring his cars and creatures to life onscreen.

Conway's story has been loosely adapted into the comedic feature Colour Me Kubrick. Anthony Frewin who worked as Kubrick's personal assistance for many years wrote the script and Brian Cook who served as Kubrick's assistant director on several films including Barry Lyndon and Eyes Wide Shut marks his directorial debut with the film. Colour Me Kubrick follows Conway on a number of adventures wherein he cadges drinks cash sex and more from unsuspecting victims ranging from a heavy metal band to a wine bar owner (Richard E.

Near the dawn of the twentieth century Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) is a widower who must tend to his business as an undertaker while looking after his brood of seven children. Brown's offspring are a singularly ill-mannered lot who have managed to drive away 17 different nannies when their father arranges for one Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) to help out with the children. McPhee is an strange looking woman with a large nose protruding teeth and pock-marked skin but it isn't long before the kids realize she has magical powers and isn't afraid to use them to help keep them in line. While the children aren't taken with McPhee's insistence on such things as saying "please" and listening to their elders it becomes clear everyone has bigger things to worry about. Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury) has insisted that if Mr. Brown cannot find a new wife within a month she'll take custody of one of the children and cut off Brown's inheritance and while Brown and the widow Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie) seem fond of one another his ineptitude in courtship seems to insure he'll never get her to the altar. But while the Brown Children realize Nanny McPhee is a formidable opponent she can also be a valuable ally as they learn to make use of her talents by being better children; they also discover that as they behave better she begins to look less frightening. Emma Thompson who played the title role in Nanny McPhee also wrote the film's screenplay., Emma Thompson | Colin Firth | Angela Lansbury | Kelly MacDonald | Patrick Barlow | Raphael Coleman | Holly Gibbs | Hebe Barnes | Zinnia Barnes | Derek Jacobi | Phyllida Law | Celia Imrie | Imelda Staunton | Eliza Bennett, Mary Poppins | I Heart Shakey | The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause | The Sound of Music | Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events | The Pacifier

Newcomer Jeffrey Chyau stars as Ernest Chin a chubby 13 year-old Chinese-American boy whose mother (Jade Wu) runs a sleazy motel in upstate New York. The clientele of The Motel are predominantly prostitutes and their johns which spurs Ernest's budding sexual curiosity. When he's not cleaning rooms eavesdropping on guests avoiding the local bully or tormenting his little sister Katie (Alexis Chin) Ernest harbors a crush on Christine (Samantha Futerman) who works at a nearby Chinese restaurant. Ernest has entered a writing contest at school with a story about his unhappy life at The Motel and won an honorable mention. His scornful mother thinks his writing is a waste of time and Ernest doesn't want her to see the story for fear that it will anger her. He's a social misfit so he's intrigued when Sam Kim (Sung Kang of Better Luck Tomorrow) a Korean-American guest who frequently brings home prostitutes befriends him. Sam takes Ernest under his wing teaching him to drive and offering him his wisdom regarding women. Of course Sam turns out to have his own serious issues with the opposite sex and his advice to Ernest about Christine may not be exactly what the boy needs. Kang won the Asian American International Film Festival screenwriting competition with his script for The Motel in 2001 and the completed film was shown at the festival in 2005. The script was workshopped at the Sundance labs where filmmaker Miguel Arteta (The Good Girl) signed on as a producer., Jeffrey Chyau | Sung Kang | Jade Wu | Samantha Futerman | Stephen Chen | Alexis Chang | Clint Jordan | Eleanor Hutchins | Ron Domingo | Jackie Nova | Jake Holbrook | Ian Boyd | Glen Brackenridge, Terri | Fat Kid Rules the World | In Between Days | Steel City | Breaking Away | The Graduate

Playing hard swaggering rock & roll that anticipated the aural chaos of punk five years before the Sex Pistols became a cause célèbre and boasting an androgynous fashion statement that made David Bowie look timid the Dolls made headlines and earned a loyal cult following between 1971 and 1976 but their look and sound were too extreme for the mass audience at the time and the fact that several members of the band had serious drug and alcohol problems hardly helped matters. After the New York Dolls finally fell apart in 1977 singer David Johansen went on to a successful solo career (scoring hit records under the alter ego Buster Poindexter) lead guitarist Johnny Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan kept the band's sound alive in the Heartbreakers and guitarist Syl Sylvain cut a few solo albums and occasionally worked with Johansen. But bassist Arthur Kane struggled for years to get his musical career back on track while battling alcoholism with little success on either front. In 1989 after a stay in the hospital a clean and sober Kane embraced the Mormon faith and through his contacts in the church he got a job working in a Mormon genealogy library in Los Angeles. Despite his quiet new life Kane's greatest dream was to someday play a reunion show with the New York Dolls and in 2004 his wish unexpectedly became a reality when British pop icon Morrissey invited the surviving members of the band to appear at a prestigious music festival he was curating.

These were large scale opera/ballet extravaganzas their music derived from folk material and the now-banned Beijing Opera and their stories and words extolling the liberation achieved for China by Mao Zedong (and all produced under the watchful eye of Mao's fourth wife Jiang Qing) and reminding the people of the miseries of life under the feudal landlords and other counter-revolutionaries. They were performed on stage throughout the country the artists involved becoming major stars in the process and broadcast on television and turned into movies; and they were the only entertainment permitted by the Chinese government for 10 years. Yang Ban Xi: The 8 Model Works focuses on the eight Yang Ban Xi (there were 15 in all) that were considered most exemplary by the government providing a look at their deliriously over-the-top productions (including huge numbers of dancers complex choreography huge choruses and in the case of the movie versions rich Technicolor filming) and their lingering appeal decades after the Cultural Revolution came to a grinding halt. Almost as compelling as the classic works in the genre -- which includes scenes choreographed with dancer/soldiers carrying machine pistols and rifles and Mao's quotations -- are the interviews with the actors dancers directors and writers some of whom remain active as performers decades later others of whom have faded into obscurity.

Despite the well-documented media coverage of Vietnam War protests that took place on college campuses across the nation few people but the most ardent history buffs remain aware of the massive protests that flourished in U.S. barracks and military bases at home and abroad. Staged by countless military men disillusioned with the ongoing war these protests reached from the hallowed halls of West Point to the bullet-riddled rice fields of Vietnam. Though hundreds of soldiers were imprisoned for voicing their controversial views and thousands more sent into exile for their subversive activities the tireless efforts of the government and media to suppress this remarkable tale would eventually falter as the dissenting voices became too numerous to silence. Thirty years after the last bombs were dropped on Vietnam the remarkable tale of the soldiers unafraid to stand up for their beliefs comes to the screen in a film that will forever alter the manner in which contemporary audiences view one of the most controversial wars in modern history., Jane Fonda | Donald Duncan | Randy Rowland | Michael Wong | Richard Boyle | Ed Asner | Troy Garity, Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry | Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Roméo Dallaire | Good Night and Good Luck. | The Final Year | One Bright Shining Moment: The Forgotten Summer of George McGovern | The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution

Devastated by the death of his mother at a young age Charles Busch escaped into the world of classic film before being spirited away from the suburbs by his caring aunt and encouraged to explore his creativity in Manhattan. Though originally rejected by a variety of directors who dismissed him as either "too odd" or "too gay" Busch eventually decided to take control of his destiny by writing his own plays and became one of the most celebrated figures in New York theater. From Busch's early success with the Theater-in-Limbo to his later success in film with Psycho Beach Party and Die Mommie Die the remarkable story of the self-made theater phenomenon is explored in this documentary from filmmakers John Catania and Charles D.

Motorcycles became an obsession that stayed with Munro for the rest of his life as he constantly tinkered with his beloved Indian machine modifying the engine and frame determined to see just how fast he could make it run. In 1967 Munro decided it was high time he proved to himself and the world just what he and his machine could do and he booked passage for the United States with the goal of breaking the world's land speed record at Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats. As Munro made his way across America to Utah he discovered not everyone took his dream seriously but some did and he made a handful of friends along the way including Ada (Diane Ladd) a widow who fell for Munro's rough charm and Fernando (Paul Rodriguez) a car dealer who offered to help him. However when he finally arrived at Bonneville Munro was told his machine was unsafe to participate in the time trials and -- far worse -- he was too old to ride. It took some intervention from a ranking American driver Jim Moffett (Chris Lawford) before Munro was given his chance to ride the famous Salt Flats.

A film producer and occasional journalist for the likes of National Lampoon magazine Alan Abel spent his life pulling off a seemingly endless series of elaborate media pranks whereby he would repeatedly drum up insane causes -- from banning human breast-feeding to slapping diapers on animals -- and appear on news broadcasts under phony aliases plugging the oddball perspectives. At other times Abel played practical jokes on the public by convincing them en masse of some fallacious truth. But the phenomenon was scarcely local in nature: Abel's hoaxes appeared on programs as institutional as Good Morning America and in publications as omnipresent as The New York Times (as when he planted an obituary in the paper on January 2 1980 erroneously indicating his own death from a heart attack). Abel also enlisted the top drawer of talent as his accomplices -- he recruited no less than Buck Henry to plug the "diapers on animals" campaign. All of this activity led various media pundits to brand Abel as one of the world's most brilliant satirists and instilled in Jenny a lifelong fascination with her father's motivations and modus operandi.

However McGovern's triumph proved to be short-lived; after his initial running mate Thomas Eagleton was revealed to have a history of mental illness the McGovern campaign went into a tailspin from which it would never recover with the incumbent Richard Nixon winning the 1972 election by a landslide. However McGovern's campaign is still remembered by many as one of the last examples of a candidate truly triumphing through the will of the people rather than working the party political machine and given the scandalous downfall of Nixon following his re-election many have wondered what America would be like today if McGovern once described by Robert F. Kennedy as "the most decent man in the Senate" had won. One Bright Shining Moment: The Forgotten Summer of George McGovern is a documentary which looks back at the McGovern campaign and explores what went right what went wrong and what was McGovern's true legacy. The film includes interviews with Howard Zinn Gloria Steinem Gary Hart Frank Mankiewicz Warren Beatty Gore Vidal Ron Kovic and McGovern himself., Amy Goodman | George McGovern | Howard Zinn | Gore Vidal | Gloria Steinem | Warren Beatty | Dick Gregory | Ron Kovic, Heir to an Execution | The Final Year | The Agronomist | The U.S. vs. John Lennon | King: A Filmed Record...

However when Schrader turned in his film to executives at Morgan Creek Productions the producers felt the film was not marketable and they opted to remake the picture with director Renny Harlin who brought a more visually aggressive approach to the story than Schrader's more contemplative vision. In 2004 Harlin's film Exorcist: The Beginning was released to middling critical and financial response while the following year Schrader's version went into limited release following film festival screenings. In Schrader's Exorcist: The Prequel Father Lankester Merrin the aging exorcist from the original story (played here by Stellan Skarsgård) is introduced in 1944 as he serves a flock in Holland during the Nazi occupation. After Nazi officers force Merrin to choose ten members of his congregation for immediate execution Merrin is left an emotionally broken man and he takes a leave of absence from his duties.

Due to health problems Conn and Baba chose to have a surrogate mother bear the child but they discovered in time that the mother they chose was not completely honest about certain health issues and due to the dangerously slow development of the fetus a bit more than three months before the baby's due date doctors advised Conn and Baba to abandon the pregnancy. Conn sternly refused to do so and young Nicholas was born by cesarean section one hundred days early. The baby spent nearly all of its first five months of life in the Neo-Natal Intensive Care Center of their hospital and once he was able to go home Nicholas still required feeding tubes and frequent visits to his medical team. The strain of taking care of Nicholas took a major toll on Conn and Baba's relationship as well as their relationship with Gabrielle and the expense and difficulty of caring for a child who will never lead a fully normal life leads many of their friends and acquaintances to wonder if their actions were for the sake of their son or a supreme indulgence of their desire for another child. Nicole Conn captured the ordeal of her first years with Nicholas on digital video and Little Man is a feature-length Documentary which explores the long and often painful road she and Gwen Baba followed on the road to their second baby.

Steeped firmly in tradition even as modern technology makes things easier than ever on farmers Peterson experiences a crucial turning point when at the tender age of ten his uncle and role model suddenly and inexplicably commits suicide. As tradition slowly begins to give way to the innovations of modern technology on the farm Peterson attempts to keep the family farm alive while later struggling with the death of his father caring for his mother and receiving a college education. After embracing the rapidly expanding cultural changes of the 1970s and becoming demonized by his community for his radical new appearance and approach to farm life Peterson suffers a crippling setback when he is forced to sell off his farming equipment much of his family's acreage and dairy cattle in the debt-ridden 1980s. Upon traveling to Mexico in an introspective attempt to nurse his still-tender wounds Peterson finds that his talent for writing offers a means of coming to terms with his turbulent past and it gives him the inspiration to return to the farm to heal both himself and his land. In the years that follow Peterson eschews modern farming techniques to give birth to Angelic Organics a financially straining dream that is nearly sunk by the harsh realities of distribution. Subsequently approached by a collection of urban consumers from Chicago in search of healthy chemical-free foods Peterson agrees to create a Community Supported Agriculture farm that helps him to realize his lifelong dream of becoming a successful farmer also restoring the tradition set forth by his grandfather and passed down through the generations., , The Future of Food | Tom Dowd and the Language of Music | a/k/a Tommy Chong | The Fight for Water: A Farm Worker Struggle | My Date With Drew | Comic-Con: Episode IV - A Fan's Hope

From the caring consideration shown to a young girl who has obviously suffered abuse at the hands of her parents to the noble support shown to a battered Muslim woman brave enough to take her husband to court for spousal abuse the support shown by Ntuba and Ngassa to their clients is unparalleled and offers a ray of hope to those who may feel that all is lost., Vera Ngassa, This Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous | The Execution of Wanda Jean | Quest | Guns & Mothers | Strange Culture | Girlhood

Jonathan and a handful of fellow Salvadorian émigrés who are his best friends stand out like sore thumbs on the block due less to their national origin than because they've rejected the hip-hop music and fashion around them in favor of old-school punk as favored by the Ramones and latter-day Latino bands such as Suicidal Tendencies.

Covering the first 30 years of the 20th century the film is set in Eatonville FL a largely black community and the home of free-spirited Janie Crawford (Halle Berry). Forced into marriage with a much older and much wealthier man at age 16 Janie endures both this unhappy union and a second equally dismal marriage trapped not only by the bonds of matrimony but also by the rigid patriarchal society of the period. Her only happiness is manifested in her ongoing illicit romance with a younger none too reliable gent known as Tea Cake (Michael Ealy) -- much to the shock and dismay of her very proper neighbors. Devotees of the original novel expressed displeasure over the film's sketchy portrayal of the protagonist a multidimensional character reduced to an impulsive hedonist for the purposes of the screenplay (though Halle Berry's towering performance more than compensates for the weaknesses of the scripts). More than that the fans of the Hurston original bemoaned the loss of the novel's pronounced racial content which harshly criticized the caste system within the Southern black community of the early 20th century whereby a light-skinned woman was regarded as "superior" and thus more desirable than her darker-skinned sisters. No one however could find fault with performance of the great Ruby Dee as Nanny nor the film's lush production trappings., Halle Berry | Michael Ealy | Ruben Santiago-Hudson | Ruby Dee | Terrence Howard | Lorraine Toussaint | Nicki Micheaux, The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman | I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings | Zora's Roots | Gone With the Wind | Cinderella Man | To Kill a Mockingbird

Howard Spence (Sam Shepard) is a veteran actor who has been a popular Western star since the mid-'70s. Spence's onscreen image as a strong principled lawman is a severe contrast to his life off the set which has been dominated by drinking drugs and promiscuous womanizing. However Spence has begun to find his hedonistic life a shallow existence and one day in the midst of filming his latest movie he simply hops on his horse and rides away eventually making his way to the small Nevada town where his mother lives. Mother (Eva Marie Saint) has little interest in seeing her wayward son after so many years but she does share a recently discovered bit of information with him -- one of Spence's former girlfriends stopped by with word that she had given birth to his son years before. Spence borrows his father's old car and drives to Butte MT where he finds Doreen (Jessica Lange) the woman who was his lover years ago. Doreen runs a tavern where her son Earl (Gabriel Mann) plays for the locals with his rock band; Spence is in fact Earl's father but the young man has no interest in meeting his biological father and shuts out Spence as the actor tries to get to know him. As Spence struggles to find some sort of familial connection in Butte he makes friends with a young woman named Sky (Sarah Polley) only to discover she was also fathered by him during his rowdy younger days.

Vicar Ivan (Mads Mikkelsen) prides himself on his efforts to help those in need by offering them a variety of odd jobs around the church and spreading the good word. After "adopting" a violent Saudi immigrant and a drunken tennis pro with a history of sexual assault Ivan is approached by Adam (Ulrich Thomsen) -- a decidedly non-reformed neo-Nazi planning to lie low in the countryside for a spell before returning to the city to once again wreak havoc. When Ivan inquires as to what his new charge's goal will be during his stay in the countryside the snide hooligan sarcastically states that he would like to bake a cake -- a response which prompts the gullible Ivan to place him in charge of the church's cherished apple tree. As ravens immediately descend upon the tree Ivan concludes that Satan is attempting to prevent Adam from realizing his true potential.

Park was in the midst of a brutal crackdown on student protestors angry workers and others whom he saw as a threat to his regime. As the film opens KCIA Chief Agent Ju (Han Suk-Gyu of Shiri) is getting rid of a hooker and her overzealous mother while President Park prepares for a banquet at his safe house with disgruntled KCIA Director Kim (Baek Yun-shik of Save the Green Planet!)

Kim has just had an unhappy doctor's visit and been told he's suffering from a bad liver and chronic fatigue.

Im insists that while some of the dialogue was necessarily invented his film tells the story of what actually happened on that historic night in 1979.

His sixth feature Tale of Cinema follows this pattern but Hong adds a new wrinkle. In the first half we're introduced to Sang-won (Lee Gi-woo of The Classic) who seems to be a ne'er-do-well and happens to run into Yong-sil (Eom Ji-weon) whom he had a crush on back when they were in school. While she finishes out her workday he goes to see a play. The two spend the evening together getting very drunk. After an abortive effort at lovemaking ("Why insist when it doesn't work?" says Yong-sil) Sang-won tells Yong-sil that he'd like to "end with a flourish." She agrees and the two forge a suicide pact. Their plan goes awry and Sang-won is hospitalized. He returns home and has a big argument with his angry mother. We next see a new character Tong-su (Kim Sang-gyeong of Memories of Murder and Hong's Turning Gate) as he exits a movie theater. It soon becomes clear that the first half of the Tale of Cinema is the short film that Tong-su has just watched as part of a retrospective of the work of a peer from film school. The filmmaker has fallen ill and his classmates are having a get-together to raise money for his family. Tong-su doesn't seem interested in going until he runs into Yong-sil the actress from the short film who has had some success in the intervening years. He stalks her for a while and eventually introduces himself and explains to Yong-sil that the filmmaker stole the story of the film from Tong-su's stories of his own life.

Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan) is the 18-year-old daughter of Ray Peyton Sr. (Michael Keaton) a once-successful stock car driver whose career is not what it once was. Maggie loves racing and is in line for a job covering NASCAR for ESPN but in her heart she'd rather be behind the wheel even though her father strictly forbids this. For Maggie's birthday Ray takes her out looking for a used car and she finds herself strangely drawn to a wrecked 1963 Volkswagen in a salvage yard. Against Ray's better judgment Maggie gets the car and a note in the glove box tells her the rust bucket is named "Herbie" and he can help her solve her problems. To her surprise the message turns out to be true -- with a little TLC Herbie is running like new and after showing his stuff in a street race Maggie persuades her naysayer dad to take her and her VW on as part of his racing team. Herbie: Fully Loaded also stars Matt Dillon as rival racer Trip Murphy Breckin Meyer as Maggie's brother (and fellow struggling driver) Ray Jr. and Justin Long as Maggie's friend Kevin., Lindsay Lohan | Justin Long | Breckin Meyer | Matt Dillon | Michael Keaton | Cheryl Hines | Jimmi Simpson | Jill Ritchie | Thomas Lennon | Jeremy Roberts | Scoot McNairy | E.E.

Boon and Mike Watt the Minutemen were at once one of the key bands in the Southern California hardcore punk scene of the '80s and a group who flew in the face of all rules including those of punk rock. Named in part because their early songs usually lasted 60 seconds or less the Minutemen were a band who stripped their music down to the bone -- short songs with minimal solos and wiry structures -- but at the same time found ways to integrate elements of funk jazz and world music into their bubbling aural bouillabaisse. Despite the stark frameworks of their music no one could argue that the Minutemen couldn't play -- bassist Watt and drummer George Hurley were one of the most potent rhythm sections in underground music and Boon's guitar work marked the place where Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart's influences met. While many punk bands bellowed harsh political rants the Minutemen offered pithy but intelligent discourse on the world around them focusing on how larger issues impacted ordinary folks in a way few people in rock ever managed. And the Minutemen's "econo" philosophy took D.I.Y. to a new level as they set out to show by example how even the most cash-strapped musicians could bring their music to the people. (Their best album Double Nickels on the Dime was a two-record set recorded for less than 2000 dollars.) The band were critical favorites on the cusp of a new level of popularity following a tour opening for R.E.M. when their career was stopped in its tracks by the tragic death of Boon in a car wreck in late 1985. We Jam Econo: The Story of the Minutemen is a documentary which tells the full story of this unusual and influential group featuring performance footage of the Minutemen on stage extensive interviews with Watt and Hurley and contributions from friends and family members.

Fifteen years later aging Bishop Taylor has announced he's retiring and Frank (Idris Elba) now a reverend seems poised to take his place. However the church is in dire financial shape and no one is sure how long Rev. Frank's flock will have a church to call home.

Not everyone regards this as good news though; Rev. Frank who sees his position in the church as a stepping stone to bigger things in the gospel music business and establishing a high-profile ministry is not eager to share the spotlight with David especially when the prodigal star begins organizing a large-scale fundraiser for the church.

Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf) was born in 1893 to a working-class family in Massachusetts and grew up fascinated by golf. However at that time golf was considered a pastime of the wealthy and privileged and British and Scottish players dominated the professional game. Ouimet's familial home was near the Brookline MA Country Club and over the stern objections of his father Francis got a job there as a caddy. Honing his skill in his spare time Francis displayed a tremendous natural talent for the game and an understanding of its strategies and 1913 he became the first amateur to play in the U.S. Open held at the Brookline Country Club. Ouimet's presence was considered little more than a novelty at the time; Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) a British champion with six tournament victories under his belt was considered a shoo-in to win with Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus) his only serious competition. However Vardon a fellow working-class boy who had overcome tuberculosis to become Britain's premier professional golfer had more in common with Ouimet than anyone expected and the tournament unexpectedly became a hard-fought competition between an established star and a promising unknown. Directed by Bill Paxton in his second directorial effort The Greatest Game Ever Played also stars Elias Koteas as Francis' father Josh Flitter as the ten-year-old boy who becomes Francis' caddy and Peyton List as Sarah Wallis Francis' sweetheart., Shia LaBeouf | Stephen Dillane | Josh Flitter | Peyton List | Elias Koteas | Marnie McPhail | Stephen Marcus | Peter Firth | Michael Weaver | James Paxton | Matthew Knight | Luke Askew | Tom Rack | Armand Laroche | Peter Hurley | Gregory Terlecki | Jonathan Higgins | Amanda Tilson | Jamie Merling | Eugenio Esposito | Robin Wilcock | Michael Sinelnikoff | Justin Ashforth | Arthur Holden | Len Cariou | Nicolas Wright | Max Kasch | Danette MacKay | Scott Faulconbridge | George Asprey | Joe Jackson | Luke Kirby | Tim Peper | Mike Nahrgang | Dawn Upshaw | James Bradford | Marc James Beauchamp | Pierre Boudreau | Johnny Griffin | Dennis St. John | Stephen Spreekmeester | Philip Pretten | Walter Massey | Melissa Carter | Jeremy Thibodeau | Alexina Cowan | Frank Fontaine | Marcel Jeannin | Brian Wrench | Nicole Braber | Kyle Macdougall | Domenico Salvaggio | Howard Ryshpan | Paul Cagelet, Seabiscuit | Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius | The Legend of Bagger Vance | Chariots of Fire | Miracle | Without Limits

Many of the world's great poets have written eloquently about the violence and madness of armed conflict among them Walt Whitman Langston Hughes Wilfred Owen Sherman Pearl and Siegfried Sassoon among many others and in 2003 when Laura Bush invited a group of poets to visit the White House for a symposium on American verse author Sam Hamill responded by founding an activist group called Poets Against the War and persuaded many of the participants to contribute verse that denounced American military policy.

After hearing a few dollars' worth Zappa offered Fischer -- who had been wandering the edges of the music business for several years with no success -- a recording contract and in 1968 the album An Evening With Wild Man Fischer was released. Sometimes funny sometimes harrowing and always boasting Fischer's wobbly matter-of-taste voice and adult-child songwriting the two-LP set of oddball tunes (including "Merry-Go-Round" "Monkeys vs. Donkeys" "Are You From Clovis" and "The Rocket Rock") sold only modestly and after an altercation at Zappa's home Fischer soon found himself without a record deal. While he remained a favorite among a tiny cult of admirers Fischer was difficult for most folks in the music industry to deal with -- he'd been diagnosed as both a manic-depressive and a paranoid-schizophrenic and his extreme mood swings obsessive need for attention and inability to conform to societal standards of public behavior have kept him at the sidelines of show business as a freak talent when his abilities are acknowledged at all. But there are a number of people who know music and believe Fischer is a genuine talent including legendary big band singer Rosemary Clooney soul icon Solomon Burke Devo leader Mark Mothersbaugh and music historian and disc jockey Dr. Demento. Derailroaded: Inside the Mind of Larry "Wild Man" Fischer is a documentary which offers a look at Fischer's torturous childhood his strange adventures in show business his struggle to be heard and his constant battle with his own demons; the film includes interviews with Fischer and his admirers as well as vintage performance clips (including his appearance on Laugh-In)., Frank Zappa | Bill Mumy | "Weird Al" Yankovic | Mark Mothersbaugh | Richard Foos | Solomon Burke, The Devil and Daniel Johnston | Searching for Sugar Man | Paul Williams Still Alive | Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten | Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin' About Him)? | Wesley Willis's Joy Rides

What troubled Lee most wasn't just that so many Asian women shared her name but that it seemed to conjure up a very particular sort of person in the eyes of many -- a quiet studious over-achiever who was cheerful Christian and never got into trouble. Lee didn't much care to be associated with a classic stereotype of an "ethnic American" desperate to assimilate with the larger culture and she began to wonder -- is every Grace Lee like this? Lee set up a website to search out other Grace Lee's around the country and followed up her research with a series of interviews that she fashioned into her film The Grace Lee Project. While Lee found plenty of women who lived up to the "Grace Lee" image she also found many who didn't including an elderly activist in Detroit's African-American community a teenage goth kid who makes voodoo dolls for fun and profit a fortysomething single parent who helped her best friend leave behind an abusive husband a Hawaiian broadcast journalist and a young troublemaker who attempted to burn down her high school.

NOVA: Hitler's Sunken Secret upholds this tradition. The episode journeys back to war-torn Europe circa 1944 and investigates a covert Allied operation little known among history buffs. After receiving numerous indications that the Norwegian ferry Hydro was toting several railroad flatcars full of "heavy water" to the Nazis -- a substance that Hitler's regime could use to build an atomic bomb that would render invincible the entire Axis -- the Allies sent a member of the Norwegian resistance to plant bombs in the prow of the Hydro thus sinking the ship and its cargo. The mission was a triumph and may have been responsible for permanently altering the course of world history. But historians have never been able to determine with any certainty if the substance actually made it on board prior to the capsizing of the vessel. In this special NOVA's explorers dive some 1300 feet to the bottom of Lake Tinn in Norway where they find the Hydro astonishingly intact after many decades and bring to the surface one of the barrels that supposedly contained the heavy water exposing its contents to a battery of scientific tests that will solve the mystery definitively., Neil Ross, Battle for Korea | The Fog of War | NOVA: Secrets of Lost Empires II - Roman Bath | South of the Border | Fidel | NOVA: Secrets of Lost Empires II - Pharaoh's Obelisk

Mograbi intercuts footage of himself discussing politics (over the phone) with a depressed cynical Palestinian friend (whose voice was dubbed by an actor to protect his identity) in the occupied territories footage of Israelis giving tours to youth groups and celebrating the aforementioned myths and footage of Palestinians dealing with the indignities of checkpoints and the capricious enforcement of seemingly arbitrary rules and regulations by Israeli soldiers. There's also a scene where the ultra-right-wing Kach Party of the late Meir Kahane holds an exuberant political rally/rock concert. Enthusiastic tour guides describe the actions of the Zealots (after the Romans had destroyed the temple in Jerusalem and built a wall around Masada the men killed the women and children then committed mass suicide rather than surrender) and those of Samson (who having been shorn of his hair and blinded by the Philistines prayed to God so that he could destroy his enemies and himself with one last surge of strength) in glowing terms for the most part. Their actions are described as unequivocally heroic and those telling the tales clearly do not see a parallel to the desperation of present-day Palestinian suicide bombers. Late in the film Mograbi expresses his outrage yelling at a group of Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint who are not letting a group of school children pass.

Ellie is young enough to still schlep to auditions back and forth across L.A. changing wardrobes and slapping on makeup en route but just old enough that the future feels "more like a threat than a promise." She lives with her vacant musician boyfriend (Mark Pellegrino) who leaves her just about as dissatisfied as any other part of her life and has a loose definition of the word "fidelity." Helping make sense of their surreal and humiliating Hollywood existence is her best friend Sam (Rebecca Rigg) another out-of-work actress trying her hand at design who attends acting classes with Ellie to stay sharp. When Ellie gets into a fender bender with a guy who claims he's a cinematographer (Scott Coffey) her perspective on her work and the dating world starts to change. Chevy Chase also makes an appearance in this series of Hollywood vignettes playing Ellie's agent. Watts Coffey and Pellegrino all worked together on David Lynch's Mulholland Drive where Watts had her breakout performance and Ellie Parker grew out of the friendship forged between Watts and director/screenwriter Coffey.

Chili takes over Athens' record company Nothing to Lose Records and begins courting Tommy's girlfriend Edie (Uma Thurman).

However after hearing this Sarah is also treated to some long-simmering local gossip about a young man who ran off with a bride-to-be after he was seduced by her mother...and that the story became the basis for the hit movie The Graduate.

The loosely structured elliptical narrative concerns three unnamed characters -- a cop (Kostas Xikominos) a photographer (Aris Servetalis) and a chambermaid (Evangelia Randou). There have been several murders of young women in the area and the cop has apparently enlisted the maid to help him reenact the crimes while the photographer records the reenactments. At other times the cop obsesses about a new BMW he wants to buy and provides counterfeit documents to Russian women who are illegal immigrants. The photographer struggles with his attraction to the maid as he drives her to and from their reenactments and tends to the many minor injuries she sustains while playing the victim. For her part she seems more concerned with the quality of her performance (she spends a lot of time rehearsing) than in any extracurricular involvement with her "co-workers." It's all shot on the fly with a constantly moving handheld camera.

Having long since sacrificed youthful ideals and values to remain in his New England hometown for the sake of his family middle-aged Miles Roby (Ed Harris) finds his "secure" little world disintegrating when his wife Janine (Helen Hunt) divorces him. Equally vexing is the emotional and financial pressure exerted by domineering town matriarch Francine Whiting (Joanne Woodward) who owns (among other things) the Empire Grill the little diner that Ed has run for several years. As he reflects on what he considers to be a wasted life Ed flashes back to memories of his curmudgeonly father Max (Paul Newman who also executive-produced the miniseries); his long-dead mother Grace (Robin Wright Penn); his scapegrace brother David (Aidan Quinn); his blossoming daughter "Tick" (Danielle Panabaker); and Francine's late husband C.B. Whiting (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Also tied in with Miles's reminiscences is the spectacular saga of the rise and fall of Empire Falls a once-prosperous mill town that has fallen into disrepair -- as have the town's once-rigid and inviolate social barriers. Despite the initial bleakness of Miles' plight and the revelation of innumerable family skeletons as the plot progresses the story is ultimately both heartwarming and life-affirming.

The story opens in the 1660s following the implementation of China's (Manchu) Qing dynasty. To quell possible nationalist uprisings the emperor issues a decree forbidding the use of martial arts and guarantees decapitation for anyone who violates that order. A class of bounty hunters quickly formed to enforce the law and collect 600 pieces of silver for each violator; the most massive and domineering of the warriors is the bald muscular Fire-Wind (Sun Honglei) a bellicose and volatile creature who lives in an elephantine tentlike dwelling on a hill. This walking terror selects Martial Village a hamlet in northwestern China as his next assignment. Meanwhile in Martial two young adults Wu Yuanyin (Charlie Young) and her ex-beau Han Zhibang) rescue an old executioner Fu Qingzhu (Lau Kar-leung) who foresees the coming wrath and acknowledges the necessity of pulling in the mythical 'Warriors of Mt. Tian' to fight Fire-Wind and his cronies. The four warriors summoned by Fu include Chu Zhaonan (Donnie Yen) and Yang Yunchong (Leon Lai) who dramatically increase the tension and bloodshed when the former develops a crush on one of Fire-Wind's hostages Green Pearl (Kim So-yeon) and decides to kidnap her - sending Fire-Wind through the roof. The critically-worshipped Hark reportedly cut two versions of this film (including a 2 1/2 hour cut and a 3-hour cut) and demonstrated incredible confidence in Qi Jian by planning it as the initial installment in a massive series of multimedia sequels including a 74-part television series an online video game comics and five additional films. The picture itself testifies to this with the setup for a sophomore installment in its conclusion.

Arin (Arin Crumley) is a struggling independent filmmaker who pays the rent by shooting and editing wedding videos; he loathes the "four-eyed two-mouthed eight-limbed" beasts known as couples in love but he would also prefer to be less lonely than he is. However Arin is terrified of talking to women and has a borderline phobia about sexually transmitted disease. On an Internet dating site Arin meets Susan (Susan Buice) an artist who wants to pursue a career in painting but in the meantime supports herself by waiting tables. Susan's attitudes about romance are only slightly more optimistic than Arin's but after exchanging photos and messages the two sense they have something in common. But both are wary of traditional courtship so they make an unusual agreement -- they can chat online they can trade videotapes they can exchange poems and sketches and they can communicate by any means besides talking to one another face-to-face. While this arrangement presents a number of challenges it also opens up their expressive abilities as well as their feelings for one another and slowly they both find themselves revitalized romantically and aesthetically. Four Eyed Monsters was written directed and edited by the real-life couple Susan Buice and Arin Crumley who in addition to playing themselves loosely based the film on their own courtship; they also distributed the film as well., Marc Scrivo | Joe Griffin | Brad Calcaterra, He Said She Said | Dan in Real Life | Breakfast at Tiffany's | Roman Holiday | Larry Crowne | Raising Helen

In the fall of 2000 Hershey assigned casting directors in five cities the task of finding actresses for his dramatic period film "Moving Still." Having remembered the profound affect that the casting process had on him as a young aspiring filmmaker Hershey intended to incorporate clips from the various auditions into the fictional film. It didn't take long for Hershey to realize however that the stories shared by 350 actresses in the seventy hours of casting tapes were enough to merit their own feature film and in the months that followed the director worked with editor Marc Grossman to edit the key moments down into an eighty-six minute film.

This experimental feature - a hybrid of fiction and documentary - broke new ground with its dual narrative; on one level it told of a couple enduring and suffering through a nasty breakup while on another it depicted Greaves as a "version" of himself ("the director") eking out a manipulative and underhanded agenda during a screen test in New York's Central Park. Greaves's sequel to that cinema vérite masterpiece Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take 2 1/2 both reprises and expounds upon some of the events and themes of the first film as the same two lovers (an interracial couple in fact) return to the screen for a 2003 shoot along with one of the crew members from the 1968 film. The paramours continue to bicker but again this only represents one level; on another the film comments on the filmmaking process by revealing the selective way in which the crew determines what the audience sees and focuses on thus providing a "running commentary" on the action., Jonathan Gordon | Steve Buscemi, Motforestilling | Blade Runner | David Holzman's Diary | Mulholland Dr. | Blood Simple | Scorpio Rising

Upon release the optimistic ex-con is distraught to discover his girlfriend Dorren (Eva Mendes) has taken up with a quick-tempered grocer (Will Ferrell) and his former partner Reyes (Jacob Vargas) has been forced into retirement by his law-abiding wife. Looking to put his hotel management know-how to good use and determined to win Doreen back Wendell soon takes a job at the Shady Grove retirement hotel. Little does Wendell realize that scheming Shady Grove head nurse Neil King (Owen Wilson) has been dabbling in fraudulent Medicare payments and forced labor and has no qualms about pinning his crimes on the carefree ex-convict. Now if benevolent knave Wendell has any hope of turning the tables on his unscrupulous nemesis and proving that nice guys don't always finish last he'll have to enlist the aid of fed-up Shady Grove residents Boyd (Seymour Cassel) Skip (Harry Dean Stanton) and Nasher (Kris Kristofferson) who are all more than willing to strike back at their casually cruel caretaker., Luke Wilson | Owen Wilson | Kris Kristofferson | Eva Mendes | Seymour Cassel | Harry Dean Stanton | Eddie Griffin | Jacob Vargas | Will Ferrell, Assisted Living | The Tao of Steve | Bottle Rocket | Slacker | Greenfingers | Dancer Texas Pop. 81

The feature (produced by ABC itself) reflects on the parent network's own lust after a serial drama in the face of drowning competition from Dallas. To solve this issue producer Aaron Spelling (here played by Nicholas Hammond) and show creators Richard and Esther Shapiro (Ritchie Singer and Pamela Reed) conceive of a modern American dress version of I Claudius about the corrupting influences of wealth and power in the Reagan era. The suits devise the scheming character of Alexis Carrington Colby and bring Joan Collins (Alice Krige) in to play her as a kind of feminine equivalent of J.R. Ewing. The main thrust of the story involves the program's rise to one of the top-tiered series on television followed by its inevitable fall when it disrespects and underestimates its regular audience.
