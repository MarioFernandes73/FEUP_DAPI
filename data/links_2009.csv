As far as Lt. Aldo Raine (aka Aldo the Apache" Brad Pitt) -- is concerned the only good Nazi is a dead Nazi. Raine's mission is to strike fear into the heart of Adolf Hitler by brutally murdering as many goose-steppers as possible or die trying. In order to accomplish that goal Lt. Raine recruits a ruthless team of cold-blooded killers known as "The Basterds" which includes baseball-bat-wielding Bostonian Sgt. Donnie Donowitz (aka "The Bear Jew" Eli Roth) and steely psychopath Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) among others. When the Basterds' secret rendezvous with turncoat German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) goes awry they learn that the Nazis will be staging the French premiere of "The Nation's Pride" a rousing propaganda film based on the exploits of German hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl) at a modest theater owned by Jewish cinephile Shoshanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) posing as a Gentile after the brutal murder of her family by the ruthless Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). As the Basterds hatch an explosive plan to take out as many Nazis as possible at the premiere they remain completely oblivious to the fact that Shoshanna too longs to bring the Third Reich to its knees and that she's willing to sacrifice her beloved theater in the process., Brad Pitt | Mélanie Laurent | Christoph Waltz | Eli Roth | Michael Fassbender | Diane Kruger | Til Schweiger | Gedeon Burkhard | Jacky Ido | B.J.

The film which marks Cameron's first dramatic feature since 1997's Titanic follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) a war veteran who gets called to the depths of space to pick up the job of his slain twin brother for the scientific arm of a megacorporation looking to mine the planet of Pandora for a valued ore. Unfortunately the biggest deposit of the prized substance lies underneath the home of the Na'vi a ten-foot-tall blue-skinned native tribe who have been at war with the security arm of the company lead by Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). Because of the planet's hostile atmosphere humans have genetically grown half-alien/half-human bodies which they can jack their consciousnesses into and explore the world in. Since Jake's brother already had an incredibly expensive Avatar grown for him he's able to connect with it using the same DNA code and experience first-hand the joys of Pandora while giving the scientific team led by Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) some well-needed protection against the planet's more hostile forces. On a chance meeting after getting separated from his team Jake's Avatar is rescued by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) a Na'vi princess who brings him into her tribe in order to give the humans a second chance at relating to this new environment. When word gets out of his increasing time with the alien species Quaritch enlists Jake to do some reconnaissance for the company as they'd like to persuade the tribe to move their home before taking more drastic measures to harness the treasure hidden below. Yet as Jake becomes one with the tribe and begins to understand the secrets of Pandora his conscience is torn between his new adopted world and the wheelchair-bound one awaiting him when the psychic connection to his Avatar is broken. Soon battle lines are drawn and Jake needs to decide which side he will fight on when the time comes. The film was shot on the proprietary FUSION digital 3D cameras developed by Cameron in collaboration with Vince Pace and offers a groundbreaking mix of live-action dramatic performances and computer-generated effects. The revolutionary motion-capture system created for the film allows the facial expressions of actors to be captured as a virtual camera system enables them to see what their computer-generated counterparts will be seeing in the film and Peter Jackson's Oscar-winning Weta Digital visual-effects house supervises Avatar's complex special effects., Sam Worthington | Zoe Saldana | Sigourney Weaver | Stephen Lang | Michelle Rodriguez | Giovanni Ribisi | CCH Pounder | Wes Studi | Laz Alonso | Dileep Rao | Matt Gerald | Jason Whyte | Scott Lawrence | Kelly Kilgour | James Pitt | Sean Patrick Murphy | Peter Dillon | Kevin Dorman | Kelson Henderson | David Van Horn | Jacob Tomuri | Michael Blain-Rozgay | Jon Curry | Peter Mensah | Julene Renee | Luke Hawker | Sonia Yee | Jahnel Curfman | Ilram Choi | Kyla Warren, John Carter | Rise of the Planet of the Apes | Battleship | Dances With Wolves | Star Trek Into Darkness | The New World

Edoardo Recchi Sr. (Gabriele Ferzetti) is the aging patriarch of a Milanese clan that has amassed a significant fortune over the years through shrewd investments in the textile business. Edoardo Sr. has a beautiful wife Allegra (Marisa Berenson) and the two have a reliable and dependable son Tancredi (Pippo Delbono). Years ago Tancredi met fell in love with and then married a woman named Emma (Tilda Swinton) amid a trip to Russia and brought her back home to Milan; their children include sons Edoardo Jr. (Flavio Parenti) and Gianluca (Mattia Zaccaro) and artist daughter Elisabetta (Alba Rohrwacher). The family gathers for a reunion at Edoardo Sr. and Allegra's villa in Milan but the happy gathering takes a somber turn when Edoardo suddenly dies not long after having lunch with his family. But the death is far from the only pivotal event that occurs that day: Edoardo Jr. also introduces his mother to a chef Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini) with whom he plans to open a restaurant and Emma finds herself drawn to the culinary artist. Meanwhile Emma learns that Elisabetta is a lesbian and though initially startled by this news she takes the liberation of her daughter as inspiration for her own liberation from confining nuptials. On impulse Emma travels to San Remo catches sight of Antonio and finds herself helplessly drawn to him. Meanwhile as Emma and Elisabetta undertake their life-changing journeys all of the men in the Recchi clan outside of Edoardo Jr. feel bound to profit-driven motives -- the commercialism of a class that has long ago shucked responsibility for its workers.

Ricardo Darín stars as Benjamín a former criminal court employee who wants to write a novel about an Argentine case from the 1970s in which a woman was raped and murdered. He confides his intentions to a judge with whom he's been secretly smitten for years Irene (Soledad Villamil) but she expresses reservations about the idea for reasons that eventually become apparent. Meanwhile flashbacks set up the central story unfolding in 1970s Argentina. In that narrative Argentina has fallen under the control of a military junta and a fair trial has become an increasingly uncommon event in that nation's courts. A woman is found raped and murdered while her husband was at work and two immigrant workers are essentially forced into confessing to the crime. Benjamín then teams up with his colleague and friend the lush Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and the two go about identifying and tagging the perpetrator of the original crime. Subtle detail in a photograph alerts Benjamin to the possibility that a man named Gómez (Javier Godino) may have been the real culprit but finding Gómez and obtaining conclusive evidence against him is no simple task. Moreover as Benjamín and Pablo struggle to have the case reopened they also find that bureaucracy and power in Argentine government have made this close to impossible.

Fifteen years later Rwanda is still coming to terms with this shocking act of genocide and filmmaker Anne Aghion who has made several films about the violence in Rwanda explores a new movement toward justice and reconciliation in this documentary. In the wake of the killings a large number of people suspected of taking part in the executions were imprisoned but many were released due to lack of evidence. Under Rwanda's new leadership communities are permitted to hold Gacacas tribunals open to the public in which suspected murders face the family and friends of people they are believed to have killed. While many of those standing before the public hearings deny their actions others are willing to finally confess to their crimes and by bringing their suspicions into the open the accusers can hopefully begin to heal their emotional wounds.

Though seldom discussed in history books (and reportedly undisclosed for half a century) fascist dictator Benito Mussolini conceived an illegitimate son by a woman named Ida Dalser -- a son Mussolini allowed to be born acknowledged and then promptly denied for the duration of his life. The tale begins in early 20th century Milan with Benito (Fabrizio Costella) working as the socialist editor of a controversial newspaper called Avanti. His dream in life involves triumphantly leading the Italian masses away from monarchy and toward a "socially emancipated future." He met the young and wealthy Ida (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) once before in Trento -- where they enjoyed a brief exchange; they re-encounter one another during Mussolini's period at Avanti and it becomes clear that Ida has fallen deeply in love with Benito. She believes wholeheartedly in his ideals and his future as the leader of Italy -- to such an extent that she sells everything she has (her apartment furniture jewelry and the beauty salon she owns) to fuel the development of his newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia. While the two become romantically entangled with Ida positively magnetized by Benito's charisma and Benito hooked on a lust for power Benito quickly switches spiritual and political allegiances overnight changing from an atheistic socialist to a deeply Catholic fascist -- Catholic because an allegiance with the Vatican will enable him to wrest and retain control over Italy's government. Benito and Ida marry and parent a son together Benito Albino Mussolini (circa 1915) but the marriage certificate soon conveniently disappears and Ida learns to her horror that Benito has married someone else. She unwisely begins to protest the situation -- so loudly and persistently that she's first forced into house arrest and then shoved permanently into an insane asylum -- raising key questions about the fate and future of her young son.

The children have never been allowed to leave the house (which is surrounded by a tall fence) and their knowledge of the outside world has been strictly controlled by their parents who have chosen to teach them only what they believe is important and have deliberately confused or misled them in many other areas. The parents quite literally treat their children like animals and the only contact the youngsters have with people outside their family is Christina (Anna Kalaitzidou) a woman who works with the father's business and comes by periodically to have sex with the eldest son (Christos Passalis). Christina makes the mistake of bringing a present for the two younger daughters (Aggeliki Papoulia and Mary Tsoni) and explains the custom is that they should give her something in return.

Many centuries ago Dr. Parnassus won immortality in a bet that found the malevolent Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) coming up short. While few would be foolish enough to try their luck against the powers of darkness a second time Dr. Parnassus did precisely that -- this time trading his mortality for youth on the understanding that his firstborn would become the property of Mr. Nick when the child reaches his or her 16th birthday. Flash-forward to the present day and Dr. Parnassus' daughter Valentina (Lily Cole) is about to celebrate her sweet sixteen. Dr. Parnassus is desperate to save his little girl from her fiery fate so when Mr. Nick arrives to collect he senses the good doctor's malaise and cooks up a wager too enticing to refuse: Dr. Parnassus and Mr. Nick will each compete to seduce five souls with possession of Valentina going to whoever manages to complete the task first. As the competition begins to heat up a mysterious man named Tony (Heath Ledger) appears. Could Tony be the one man capable of helping Dr. Parnassus win the competition and save Valentina? While the sudden death of prominent Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus player Heath Ledger in January of 2008 left Gilliam and company scrambling to find a means of salvaging the film -- which was already well into principal photography at the time -- the cavalry soon arrived in the form of Johnny Depp Jude Law and Colin Farrell who each serve as alternate-dimension versions of Tony when the character crosses through a paranormal mirror., Heath Ledger | Christopher Plummer | Tom Waits | Johnny Depp | Jude Law | Colin Farrell | Verne Troyer | Andrew Garfield | Lily Cole | Richard Riddell | Katie Lyons | Richard Shanks | Johnny Harris | Mark Benton | Lewis Gott | Sian Scott | Moya Brady | Charles McKeown | Mackenzie Gray | Yurij Kis | Ian Wallace | Amanda Walker | Joann Condon | Carolyn Pickles | Paloma Faith | Craig Fraser | Amy Marston | Gwendoline Christie | Lucy Russell | Maggie Steed | Ben Cartwright | Gavin Rolph | Bobbi Bysouth | Vitaliy Kravchenko | Ray Cooper | Emil Hostina | Igor Ingelsman | Sarah Groundwater | Dean Moen | Fraser Aitcheson | Michael Bean | Jase-Anthony Griffith | John Stewart | Chris Cochrane | Pearce Visser | Patrick Bahrich | Georgina Hegedos | Cassandra Sawtell | Carrie Genzel | Mark Oliver | Peter Stormare | Donna Lysell | Michael Eklund | Rahul Singh | Ryan Grantham | D.

It's been 28 years since the aliens made first contact but there was never any attack from the skies nor any profound technological revelation capable of advancing our society. Instead the aliens were treated as refugees. They were the last of their kind and in order to accommodate them the government of South Africa set up a makeshift home in District 9 as politicians and world leaders debated how to handle the situation. As the humans begin to grow wary of the unwelcome intruders a private company called Multi-National United (MNU) is assigned the task of controlling the aliens. But MNU is less interested in the aliens' welfare than attempting to understand how their weaponry works. Should they manage to make that breakthrough they will receive tremendous profits to fund their research. Unfortunately the highly advanced weaponry requires alien DNA in order to be activated. When MNU field operative Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is exposed to biotechnology that causes his DNA to mutate the tensions between the aliens and the humans intensifies. Wikus is the key to unlocking the alien's technology and he quickly becomes the most wanted man on the planet.

Céline (Julie Sokolowski) the daughter of a wealthy and respected family is a 20-year-old student of theology whose passion for Christianity is so strong some find it unnerving. Céline has been studying at a convent but her single-minded devotion leads the mother superior to ask Céline to leave and go out into the world. As Céline strives to find herself in a world that seems to have lost its moral compass she meets Yassine (Yassine Salime) a Muslim teenager who lives in the city. Yassine is quite taken with Céline and they strike up a friendship but while she warily hangs out with his friends and goes to nightclubs with him she stubbornly denies him physical affection insisting her spiritual path is more important to her than sex. Yassine introduces Céline to his brother Nassir (Karl Sarafidis) a firmly committed Muslim and in him Céline finds a kindred spirit -- despite the differences in their faiths their belief is equally powerful and they share the opinion that they live in a world that has cut itself off from God.

When the citizens of Budrus realized that Israel's Separation Barrier would essentially destroy their remote village Palestinian community organizer Ayed Morrar made it his mission to fight back by uniting Fatah and Hamas members as well as Israeli supporters against the massive fence. Although their success seemed decidedly uncertain at first their cause would soon get a much-needed boost when Morrar's 15-year-old daughter Iltezam rallied women to the cause as well. Incredibly it was Iltezam's faction that stood their ground on the front lines fearlessly confronting heavily armed soldiers twice their size. The result was a nonviolent protest that has since had a ripple effect throughout the war-torn Middle East inspiring people who were once bitter enemies to lay down their weapons and work together for peace., , The Color of Olives | Checkpoint | Encounter Point | Promises | The Fence

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis one of Galella's favorite subjects took him to court in 1972 to prevent him from obsessively following her (Galella was given a restraining order preventing him from coming within 150 feet of her for the rest of her life) while in 1973 Marlon Brando took a more direct approach punching the photographer in the face and breaking his jaw as Galella tried to snap his picture. While Galella seemingly has little sense of shame or propriety about his work he also had a gift for capturing exciting images on the run and unlike most of his peers his work has been shown in galleries around the world and he's widely regarded as the most gifted artist in his chosen field. Filmmaker Leon Gast offers a look at the public and private sides of Ron Galella in the documentary Smash His Camera in which he talks about his career his attitude abut celebrity culture and his run-ins with some of his subjects.

The editors of the video created a gag reel in which Rebney's colorful bursts of anger were strung together for comic effect and the footage circulated on dubbed videotapes until 2005. That year someone posted Rebney's tirade online and before long "Winnebago Man" became an Internet sensation with the video racking up countless views and inspiring a number of parodies and on-line tributes. But who was Jack Rebney why was he in such a lousy mood and is he aware of his underground fame today? Filmmaker Ben Steinbauer decided to find out and his search to locate Rebney and uncover the true story behind his moment of Internet infamy is chronicled in the documentary Winnebago Man.

Ewing? Filmmaker Jaak Kilmi takes a witty look at the role of pop culture in the collapse of the Soviet Union and its allies in this documentary. In Disko & Tuumasoda (aka Disco and Atomic War) Kilmi uses Estonia as an example of the rise of Western cultural influences in Soviet-controlled nations in the 1970s. Estonia bordered Russia but was across a gulf from Finland and it was fairly easy for many Estonians to pick up Finnish radio and television broadcasts. While the Soviet-controlled Estonian media attempted to convince citizens of the danger and decadence of America and its allies folks with the right television antennas could pull in U.S.-produced television shows like Dallas (as well as late-night showings of softcore porn films illegal under Soviet rule). Consequently the joys of nighttime soap operas American and British pop music and Western fashions may have had as much to do with the collapse of communism as any explicit political movement. Kilmi also reveals how capitalism found a foothold in Estonia through a black market in television aerials capable of pulling in stations from Finland., Jaan Tootsen | Gerda Viira | Oskar Vuks | Toomas Pool | Jaan-Joosep Puusaag | Einar Kotka | Aleksandr Aug | Birgit Veemaa | Katrin Roosipuu, The Soviet Story | The Power of the Powerless | People's Century: People Power - The End of Soviet-Style Communism | The Atomic Cafe | ABC News: The Week That Shook the World - The Soviet Coup

Growing up in Houston TX Hicks began performing at the age of 15 and after earning a large and loyal following in Texas he moved to L.A. and began working the comedy circuit nationwide. As Hicks maintained a punishing touring schedule (often performing 250 to 300 nights a year) he kept honing and refining his act combining acidic political and social commentary with tales of his sexual obsessions surreal visions of the world around him and experiences with drugs. In 1990 Hicks performed in the United Kingdom for the first time and there he became a star though he failed to attract the same sort of audience in the United States. A few years later Hicks seemed on the verge of a commercial breakthrough in America when he learned he had a rare and virulent form of cancer; he died on February 24 1994 at the age of 32. Filmmaker Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas chronicle the life art and philosophy of a singular performer with the documentary American: The Bill Hicks Story. Featuring interviews with Hicks' closest friends and family members the film uses digital animation to bring his standup routines to life and create a visual complement to his comedic vision.

The Boys in the Band concerned a handful of gay men who gathered for a birthday party on Manhattan's Upper East Side where the celebration turns sour after alcohol loosens the tongues of some of the guests and they share opinions they had previously kept hidden. While some critics felt some of the characters reflected negative stereotypical views of homosexuals many others praised it for dealing openly and honestly with the gay community in a way that was unprecedented in mainstream entertainment. The play enjoyed a run of over a thousand performances and in 1970 William Friedkin adapted the play for the cinema using the complete original cast in his film version. Filmmaker Crayton Robey offers an insiders' look at how Mart Crowley's drama became a groundbreaking event in both theater and cinema in the documentary Making the Boys which includes interviews with Crowley; actor Laurence Luckinbill (who played Hank in the original production); playwrights Edward Albee Michael Cunningham Paul Rudnick and Tony Kushner; and Robert Wagner who worked with Crowley on the television series Hart to Hart.

The film was chalked up by many as an homage to the gory European giallos of the 1960s and 1970s but it's also influenced heavily by the narratively cryptic surrealism of directors such as David Lynch. Directors Bruno Forzani and Hélène Cattet undertake an episodic approach by dividing the material into three thematically linked segments. In the first a young girl is at home as her grandfather dies and her grandmother begins performing a series of bizarre rituals designed to either bring him back to life or ease his passage to the next world; as this is happening the girl becomes aware that her parents are making love elsewhere in the house. Years later a teenage girl goes into town with her mother to run some errands comes face to face with the power of her sexuality and learns how she can use her allure to change the behavior of men. In the final segment an adult woman returns to the house where she grew up which has fallen into disrepair -- and discovers that she may not be alone.

Natha (Omkar Das Manikpuri) and Budhia (Raghubir Yadav) are two brothers who run a family farm in Peepli a small town in India. Business has been bad on the farm and the brothers are unable to repay a government loan with a default judgment due any day. When the brothers call on a local politician to ask if anything can be done while they wait for a judge's ruling on their case he facetiously suggests that one of them could commit suicide since the government would pay benefits to the surviving family members. Natha doesn't realize the official is joking and volunteers to kill himself while a television reporter overhears the conversation and immediately puts the story on the air. Soon a handful of newsmen have shown up at Natha's house waiting to find out if the farmer will indeed kill himself and before long it seems as if most of the nation is watching with everyone sharing their opinions on Natha and his dilemma. The story is a boon to the news media but bad for the local politicians who are standing for re-election that day as folks stay away from the polls to follow Natha's story.

On March 18 2003 while she was trying to keep Palestinian homes in Rafah (on the border between Gaza and Egypt) from being destroyed Corrie was killed by an armored bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces. The exact circumstances of her death have been disputed. Fellow ISM members who witnessed the incident claim that the bulldozer driver deliberately ran over Corrie. The IDF's investigation found that the driver was unable to see Corrie and that she was not run over by the bulldozer but was killed by debris that was pushed onto her. French-Israeli filmmaker Simone Bitton examines the case in her controversial feature documentary Rachel. Corrie's letters and emails describing her experiences working with the Palestinians in Gaza are read aloud in the film by her friends and relatives. Bitton interviews Palestinians ISM members and Israeli military personnel who were involved in the incident and its aftermath. Rachel had its North American Premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival where it was shown in the Showcase section. While its Tribeca screenings passed fairly quietly the film aroused tremendous controversy when it was later shown at the 2009 San Francisco Jewish Film Festival. Sponsors of the festival threatened to withdraw their support and the SFJFF was further criticized (by the Israel Consul General among others) for inviting Cindi Corrie Rachel's mother to speak after the film.

With Greenaway offering an onscreen narration through much of the film the director presents an illustrated lecture on the artist the painting and the many circumstances behind it -- the culture and politics of Holland in the 17th century the real-life figures depicted in the painting (among them Capt. Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburgh) the controversy that surrounded these men and the subtle suggestions Rembrandt's representation advanced -- and why some believe backlash over "The Night Watch" brought Rembrandt's career to a premature end. In addition to paintings and text Greenaway also features several actors who are "interviewed" as key figures in the story: Martin Freeman appears as Rembrandt (as he did in Nightwatching) Eva Birthistle portrays his wife Saskia and Emily Holmes and Jodhi May impersonate their household servants.

Inspired by the journals kept by Suleiman's father the first episode takes place in 1948 as the Arab resistance movement begins to crumble though Fuad Suleiman (Saleh Bakri) is determined to keep up the fight.

A few years later Elia (Ayman Espanioli) has a brush with more powerful authorities who attempt to toss him out of Israel on a minor offense. Finally Elia (Elia Suleiman) returns home to look after his elderly mother (Samar Qudha Tanus) and discovers how little has changed as many of his old friends have been warming the same barstools since he left.

Ruppert a former police officer predicted the Wall Street debacle of 2008 several years before the fact at a time when most analysts were still imagining infinite growth for the stock market and major investment banks. Since then his vision of the world's future has grown only darker. As Ruppert sees it civilization and the global economy has yet to wean itself off fossil fuels and when the world's supply of oil finally runs out it will lead to a global financial catastrophe that will leave no one unscathed. But while most of what Ruppert has to say bears the ring of truth there's a small audience for his dire message -- the primary medium for his work is a self-published newsletter and his most recent book has done so poorly in the marketplace that he faces eviction from his home. Is Ruppert right? And if he is why doesn't anyone care?

One of Mugabe's most notorious programs has been his policy of seizing farms owned by white Africans and turning them over to individuals affiliated with the Mugabe government; many of these nationalized farms have been put in the hands of people with little practical background in raising crops with the nation's agricultural base thrown into chaos. Many white land owners in Zimbabwe have fled the country but 75-year-old Michael Campbell is a veteran family farmer who has chosen to stay and fight; rather than turn over his property Campbell has taken his case to an international court accusing the government of Zimbabwe of racial discrimination and violation of his human rights by claiming ownership of his rightful property.

But after her story broke no witnesses came forward to support her and security cameras at the train station revealed no such attack; the woman later admitted that she had ripped her own clothes drawn swastikas on her own stomach and fabricated the entire story. With the drama Fille du Rer acclaimed French writer-director André Téchiné presents a thinly veiled fictionalization of the same events. Émilie Dequenne stars as Jeanne an unemployed girl who lives with her mother (Catherine Deneuve) in a Parisian suburb and spends the majority of her free time rollerblading. She has little knowledge of -- or interest in -- history or politics and remains withdrawn insular and sullen keeping the majority of her thoughts and observations to herself. Circumstances change just a bit when Jeanne enters a live-in relationship with a beefy thuggish wrestler boyfriend Franck (Nicolas Duvauchelle) living in a dingy warehouse but violence soon erupts between the two. Jeanne also becomes acquainted with an attorney-cum-ex-boyfriend of her mother's (Michel Blanc) whose involvement in Judaic causes and his politically committed family prompt even greater feelings of alienation and isolation in Jeanne. When Franck's involvement in criminal activities comes to light and the police intervene Jeanne perversely reasons that she can only become tied to history by inventing a role for herself and decides to fabricate said story about the train -- little realizing the calamitous consequences that it will engender., Émilie Dequenne | Catherine Deneuve | Michel Blanc | Ronit Elkabetz | Mathieu Demy | Nicolas Duvauchelle | Jeremy Quaegebeur, Doubt | A Cry in the Dark | The Memory Thief | The Crucible | In the Name of My Daughter | Mr. Klein

However as Jose tries to determine how viable the canal would be given the land and minerals in the area he discovers that the people of Sertao are of two minds about the project -- while it would bring new life to the dry and dusty land it would also force hundreds of people to give up their homes and start again somewhere else. As Jose ponders the geological facts and personal feelings about the new canal he can't help but think of his own circumstances: his wife left him shortly before he set out on his trip and despite plenty of conversations with himself and a few assignations with prostitutes he's wildly uncertain about how he feels or where he stands.

Lucie's husband Ludek (Milan Mikulcik) who is working on the film as a sound engineer reveals to her that he's been having an affair with a former girlfriend Radka (Petra Hrebickova); while Lucie tries to be rational about what's happened it doesn't make her inclined to trust Ludek or what he has to say. But as the filmmakers look into Pavel's life they discover evidence that casts an ugly shadow on his past -- documents suggest Pavel worked as an undercover agent for Czech intelligence informing on his fellow radicals and that his friend and colleague Borek (Antonin Kratochvil) played an unexpected role in his life.

Hildegard (Barbara Sukowa) came to live at the Disibodenberg abbey when she was a youngster and grew up under the watchful but compassionate eye of Jutta the Holy (Mareile Blendl). In her teens Hildegard became a nun and was known among her peers for her generous nature and desire to help others; she developed a talent for formulating herbal medicine as well as gift for composing music and after three decades she was selected to become a magistra at the abbey. Hildegard was born during a time when women were expected to serve and not to preach but she fearlessly began speaking to others about her religious visions which she used as a vehicle to share lessons in faith in a manner that circumvented the rules. Hildegard also fearlessly denounced the violent self-abasement that was common among holy men and women of her day believing that a faith born of kindness and devotion was more valuable than that which came from fear and pain. While Hildegard won may friends through her work she also gained more than a few enemies and while some denounced her for not restricting herself to the traditional role of a woman in the church others contended that her holy visions were not the work of the Lord but of the Devil.

Kunstler was a man who thrived on controversial cases; in the 1960s he specialized in defending clients who ran afoul of the law on civil rights and free speech issues and he spoke on behalf of Martin Luther King Malcolm X Lenny Bruce members of the Black Panther Party Native American activists and prisoner's rights groups. Kunstler found himself in the national media spotlight in 1969 when he defended "the Chicago Eight" activists who were accused of organizing riots during the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention; his flamboyant style in the courtroom fascinated the press and some believe he soon became as interested in getting his name in the papers and his face on television as he was in the law. In his later years Kunstler developed a reputation as a man who would defend clients no one else would touch including drug dealers accused rapists organized crime figures and suspected terrorists though he remained a passionate advocate of the American legal system. Kunstler's daughters Emily and Sarah began asking their famous dad questions about his career and his ideals as children armed with a home movie camera and they've used some of that footage -- along with vintage newsreels and interviews with Kunstler's friends foes and clients -- as the basis for the film William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe a biographical portrait of the man and his legacy.

Paul (Alex Karpovsky) and Rudy (Chris Doubek) are brothers who are also both writers though their careers are on opposite ends of the spectrum of success; Paul has authored a series of fantasy novels for kids that have made him a very wealthy man while Rudy's bitter and more personal work makes no inroads into the marketplace. Rudy is envious of his brother's good fortune in part because he helped him come up with the characters for his stories when they were children. Rudy does have one thing that Paul wants however -- Rudy's wife Diana (Heather Kafka) who is disenchanted with her husband's dour attitude and money troubles and wants a divorce. After Diana finally kicks Rudy out of their home he's reduced to living out of his car until Paul takes pity on him and pays for an extended stay at a hotel. What Rudy doesn't know is that Paul has given him a place to stay so he can invite Diana on a getaway to a luxury ski resort in Utah. Once Rudy catches on that Paul is seducing his ex-wife Rudy makes his way to Utah and sneaks into their chalet following their movements as he plots his revenge. Lovers of Hate received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival -- fitting since Poyser shot the Utah sequences in Park City while attending the Sundance Festival in 2009 (using the bungalow where he and a number of other Austin TX filmmakers were staying as the set for Paul and Diana's love nest)., Chris Doubek | Heather Kafka | Alex Karpovsky | Zach Green, Your Sister's Sister | The Graduate | Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid | Broadcast News | Gone With the Wind | An American in Paris

However it wasn't until Rutsey left the group and Neil Peart signed on as their new drummer that Rush's signature sound took shape a muscular variation on progressive rock marked by the keen instrumental prowess of all three members and the lyrically and musically adventurous songwriting of Peart. With little help from the music press or mainstream radio Rush grew into a commercial powerhouse releasing a long string of multi-platinum albums and playing sold-out shows in North America and Europe. A notoriously reclusive band Rush offer their fans a rare and intimate behind-the-scenes look into their music and their career in the documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage which features exclusive interviews with the members of the group and footage of them on- and off-stage as well as contributions from a number of famous fans -- from Kirk Hammett of Metallica and Gene Simmons of KISS to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and actor and musician Jack Black.

But people weren't the only victims of the storm; while rescue efforts attempted to evacuate families in Louisiana Mississippi Florida and other regions hit by Katrina most were forced to leave their pets behind and after the worst of the storm had passed animal welfare workers from around the country traveled to the South and saved nearly 15000 dogs and cats who were left behind. Many of these pets were adopted by new families who gave them loving homes but this led to an unexpected dilemma -- when the former owners made their way back home to rebuild their homes and their lives they wanted to be reunited with the pets that they'd raised and cared for. The new masters however were often reluctant to give up the pets that they'd come to love leading to an emotional tug of war between two households who had a strong emotional connection to the same animal. Filmmaker Geralyn Pezanoski explores how many pets were ignored during the Katrina debacle and how some of these survivors are caught in the middle of angry custody battles in the documentary Mine which received its world premiere at the 2009 South by Southwest Film Festival., , Trouble the Water | When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts | Born on the Fourth of July | The Insider | Sicko | Darfur Now

Savitsky barely had a penny to his name when he started collecting the works of Russian artists who were shot or shopped off to gulags for creating works that didn't toe the party line. Incredibly he raised the funds to rescue the remarkable paintings by borrowing from the very same groups that had worked to get them banned in the first place. In the course of his journeys Savitsky discovered that a group of obscure artists had settled in Uzbekistan in the wake of the 1917 Russian Revolution. Intrigued by the Islamic culture they encountered there the artists began infusing their European modernist works with Eastern traditionalism and gave birth to a movement that was truly unique. Fully realizing that he could be dubbed an "enemy of the people" for his efforts in preserving this art Savitsky selflessly dedicated his life to ensuring that these works would not be lost to the ravages of time or the legacy of tyranny., Ben Kingsley | Sally Field | Ed Asner, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Enter Here | In the Realms of the Unreal | Portrait of Wally | The Art of the Steal | William Eggleston in the Real World | Dirty Hands: The Art & Crimes of David Choe

Benazir was bright (she studied at Harvard and Oxford) personable and had a campaigner's instincts but it was anyone's guess how successful any woman could be in a Muslim nation where the authority of women was still questioned.

In 2007 Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan hoping to run for office and reassert the power of democracy at a time when Muslim fundamentalist leadership threatened to move political progress backward but her assassination in December 2007 put an end to that dream.

When Manchester detective Peter Hunter (Paddy Considine) arrives in Yorkshire to investigate he discovers a number of inconsistencies in the official report and begins to suspect foul play. Unfortunately for both Detective Hunter and the growing list of victims the local police seem unusually tight-lipped about the case. Perhaps their refusal to aid Detective Hunter in his investigation has something to do with his previous visit to Yorkshire in 1974 when he rubbed the local authorities the wrong way while investigating a shooting.

In February 2004 a birder kayaking in an Arkansas swamp videotaped what he believed was a remarkable find -- an ivory-billed woodpecker a large and impressive creature that was believed to have been extinct for half a century after unregulated clear-cutting of forests destroyed its habitat. The sighting was major news among avian researchers and Cornell University's Ornithology Lab sent a team to Arkansas in hopes of finding a living ivory-billed woodpecker. Hundreds of bird watchers followed them to Brinkley AR in hopes of seeing the great bird themselves and in a town that had been caught in an economic tailspin the appearance of the woodpecker seemed like a stroke of remarkable good luck. Soon local entrepreneurs were opening gift shops and motels to take advantage of the influx of birders and a local barber even devised a "woodpecker haircut." But amidst the excitement came a number of researchers who said that they had little hard evidence that what had been sighted was in fact an ivory-billed woodpecker leading to a contentious debate among bird fanciers and folks in Brinkley who didn't want to lose their windfall. Filmmaker Scott Crocker takes an in-depth look at the sudden reappearance of the ivory-billed woodpecker and its many consequences in the documentary Ghost Bird which was an official selection at the 2009 Hot Docs International Film Festival., David Sibley | Jerome Jackson, John James Audubon: The Birds of America | Galapagos | The Messenger | Chasing Ice | The 11th Hour | Aliens of the Deep

The zaballeen would pick up trash from the streets sometimes being paid a few pennies for their efforts but most would support themselves by selling cans bottles and other materials they found to recycling firms. This makeshift system proved to be surprisingly effective and efficient but when Cairo's local government entered into a contract with an international sanitation firm to collect the city's trash some 60000 zaballeen suddenly found themselves without a livelihood. Filmmaker Mai Iskander examines the culture of Cairo's "garbage people" through the lives of three young men who collect and recycle trash in the documentary Garbage Dreams. Iskander spent four years following and filming quick-witted 16-year-old Osama class-conscious 18-year-old Nabil and bright 17-year-old Adham as they struggle to make a living and a future in a profession whose days are numbered.

Or at least that's what the North Korean government was led to believe when they gave them permission to do a performance tour of the country; in truth "the Red Chapel" was formed by a pair of improvisational comics (who are in fact of Korean heritage) and a radical journalist who traveled to North Korea in hopes of using subversive satirical performances as a commentary on the nation's oppressive policies and lamentable human rights record. One of the performers happens to be handicapped and accentuates his condition as a way of throwing those around him off track. One of the "Red Chapel" pranksters Mads Brügger brought along a video camera to chronicle their journey through Korea and Det Rode Kapel (aka The Red Chapel) is a documentary that offers a glimpse of their performances and the often surprising reactions they received.

Berg -- who was best-known to the public in the identity of her character Molly Goldberg -- occupied a unique niche in the fabric of American life and throughout the 1930s she and Eleanor Roosevelt the wife of the president competed annually in polls for the title of most prominent woman in America. Berg was even called "The First Lady of Radio" at a time when radio was king. Later on in the television era she invented the family sitcom as we came to know it and did battle against the Red Scare and the blacklist. Director Aviva Kempner's documentary gives an intimate and detailed a look at the life of Berg who died in 1966 virtually forgotten by the executives of the industry that she helped build. In the process she and the other participants and their widows and children as well as admirers such as United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explain how this woman an articulate and intelligent first-generation Jewish American with little formal background in writing and no knowledge of the media rose to such success in just a few years -- and why she was forgotten and swept aside almost as quickly at the other end of her career.

Romney's career took him to the West Coast in the mid-'60s where he fell in with Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters and became a key figure in the early days of the hippie movement. Adopting the nickname "Wavy Gravy" he embraced the persona of a playful clown in part because he observed that hippies got arrested at protest marches but clowns in parades did not. Wavy Gravy and his wife formed a commune in Berkley CA called the Hog Farm and members of the group were hired to help with security at the Woodstock rock festival in 1969 with Romney dubbing his group "The Please Force." Wavy Gravy became one of the more visible figures in the '60s counterculture scene but unlike some of his peers he never lost track of the ideals that came to symbolize the decade; well into his seventies Wavy Gravy still works on behalf of environmental concerns operates a camp (Camp Winnarainbow) that teaches clowning to homeless and underprivileged children helps run a charitable organization (the Seva Foundation) that funds eye care for the poor in the Third World and works with children living with brain injuries. Described by his friend Paul Krasner as "the illegitimate son of Harpo Marx and Mother Theresa" Hugh Romney's remarkable life story is brought to the screen by filmmaker Michelle Esrick in the documentary Saint Misbehavin': The Wavy Gravy Movie.

Veit Harlan was a film director who unlike many noted German auteurs chose to stay in his homeland after Adolf Hitler rose to power and made films under the supervision of the Nazi propaganda authorities. Harlan's best-known picture was Jud Süss (aka Jew Süss) a vehemently anti-Semitic drama that was required viewing for Hitler's top brass a frequent attraction in Germany and occupied countries and with the possible exception of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will the most notorious film to emerge from the Third Reich. Harlan was tried for his work as a Nazi propagandist though he insisted he was coerced into making Jud Süss and other pro-Nazi films (a contention disputed by a number of his colleagues); two trials failed to convict Harlan and he continued to work in Europe until his death in 1964. Filmmaker Felix Moeller presents a look at the life and work of this most notorious director in the documentary Harlan: Im Schatten von Jud Süss (aka Harlan: In the Shadow of Jew Süss) which examines Harlan's career as well as the impact his legacy has had on his descendants some of whom have struggled to right Harlan's wrongs while others have preferred to keep their distance from his tainted reputation.

Silvio Berlusconi is the prime minister of Italy; he also owns and operates a private television outlet Mediaset as well as overseeing operations at RAI Italy's state-run television network. As a result Berlusconi has a hand in 90 percent of all television outlets currently broadcasting in the country. So to what degree is the prime minister responsible for the current state of Italian television in which semi-nude women are a constant presence and intelligent political commentary is all but impossible to find? Videocracy ponders Berlusconi's place in the current Italian media environment as well as profiling three characters who reflect the nation's cultural status quo. Ricky Canevali is a half-bright but handsome would-be pop star who is hoping his good looks and charisma will win out over his lack of talent in the eyes of the public. Lele Mora is a highly successful television agent who can help make anyone a star; he's also a close friend of Berlusconi who openly admires the leader comparing him to another celebrated Italian politician Benito Mussolini. And Fabrizio Corona is Italy's most celebrated paparazzo an amoral celebrity photographer who is willing to sell his pictures to the highest bidder -- which is sometimes the stars themselves.

Pujol was a Spaniard who was determined to work against the Axis during World War II and provided German intelligence with information that he'd received through a network of 27 spies in Europe and the U.K. Of course those spies never existed the information he gave the Germans was largely false and his insistence to the Germans that the Normandy landing was just a distraction helped make the successful D-Day campaign possible. However while the Germans didn't know who Pujol was neither did the British and while he was reported dead in 1949 three decades later it was discovered that Pujol was alive and using another identity in South America.

Despite its status as an illegal narcotic marijuana is the number one cash crop in 12 states. In 30 others it's in the top three. But still the question remains: why despite the fact that millions of Americans admit to having tried marijuana -- and many others claim to smoke it on a regular basis -- is this one controversial plant still illegal despite the fact that it's never been attributed to a single death from overdose and the risks associated with alcohol abuse far outweigh the risks of regular marijuana consumption? Pay a visit to a place known as the Emerald Triangle in California where medicinal marijuana crops flourish. If it weren't for this profitable cash crop odds are the local economy would be flat on its back and tax payers would be going hungry.

In Double Take Grimonprez explores the paranoia of America during the Cold War while using clips of the classic television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents as a commentary on America's mood during the 1950s and '60s. As Grimonprez ponders the symbiotic nature of politics and popular culture he also presents a fictional narrative (inspired by a short story by Jorge Luis Borges) in which Hitchcock (played by Ron Burrage and voiced by Mark Perry) while on a studio lot encounters a man who looks exactly like him a situation that popped up more than once in the great director's films. Hitchcock once said "If you meet your double you should kill him" but is that advice the great man takes himself? And how do these doubles reflect a world in which fear and nationalism have taken center stage?

In the years before Ronald Reagan took office Manhattan was in ruins. But true art has never come from comfort and it was precisely those dire circumstances that inspired artists like Jim Jarmusch Lizzy Borden and Amos Poe to produce some of their best works. Taking their cues from punk rock and new wave music these young maverick filmmakers confronted viewers with a stark reality that stood in powerful contrast to the escapist product being churned out by Hollywood. Interviews with the aforementioned artists as well as Debbie Harry Steve Buscemi John Waters John Lurie Lydia Lunch and Thurston Moore reveal how a group of young visionaries pooled their resources to birth a film movement that produced some of the most challenging art of the 20th century., Jim Jarmusch | Deborah Harry | Steve Buscemi | Fab 5 Freddy | Thurston Moore | Richard Kern | Lydia Lunch | John Waters | Nick Zedd, Downtown 81 | Vortex | Wild Style | Unmade Beds | American Hardcore | We Jam Econo: The Story of the Minutemen

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition of "gerrymandering" reads: "to divide a territorial unit into election districts to give one political party an electoral majority in a large number of districts while concentrating the voting strength of the opposition in as few districts as possible." As the debate surrounding the reliability of the electoral system rages the question of how to ensure that the system is more accurate and accountable comes up time and again. Can that broken system ever be fixed? By posing that question among many others to governors state representatives Supreme Court justices political strategists party chairmen scholars and journalists Reichert proposes that the fundamental democratic premise that voters actually choose their elected representative may be a falsehood implemented to create the illusion of democracy., Gray Davis | Kathay Feng | Ed Rollins | Arnold Schwarzenegger | George Stonefish | Pete Wilson, Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election | Casino Jack and the United States of Money | This Is What Democracy Looks Like | The Party's Over | The War Room | Feed

Cockburn interviews bankers and former bankers about their roles and what they observed. The roots of the collapse are traced back to the December 2000 passage of the Commodities Futures Modernization Act a deregulation bill proposed by then-senator Phil Gramm. The film details how the passage of that bill allowed financial institutions like Bear Stearns to make billions by repackaging mortgages into "esoteric products" like CDOs. In addition to looking at how these complex moneymaking schemes crippled the financial and insurance industries Cockburn takes a hard look at the devastating impact of the mortgage crisis in both inner-city Baltimore and Stockton CA. The film points out that African-Americans were four times as likely to obtain a subprime mortgage as whites suggesting that they were specifically targeted by predatory lenders. Cockburn shows the devastation wreaked on individual lives and the community by evictions and bankruptcies. She also explores the environmental impact the crisis has had on upper-middle-class Stockton where abandoned swimming pools have become a breeding ground for disease-carrying mosquitoes and rodents and where abandoned homes are broken into and converted into meth labs.

The device is not working too well for Oona (Emma Caulfield who played Anya on Buffy the Vampire Slayer) because her TiMER is blank.

But so far no dice. Oona's twentysomething half sister Steph (Michelle Borth) is also unlucky. Her TiMER tells her she won't meet Mr. Right for about 20 more years. While Steph sows her wild oats resigned not to commit to a relationship Oona approaching 30 obsesses over her TiMER.

For Defamation Shamir adopts a completely different filmmaking style. Defamation which explores anti-Semitism is a more personal "essay film" in the style of Michael Moore or Nick Broomfield. (The filmmaker has described it as "a personal journey.") Shamir dispenses with subjectivity appearing on camera to ask pointed questions and explaining his point-of-view in a wry voice-over. Claiming that having lived in Israel all his life he's never experienced anti-Semitism (though he points out he's read a lot about it in Israeli newspapers) Shamir travels to America to discover what the phenomenon is all about. He goes to New York where he looks into alleged incidents of anti-Semitism that turn out to be relatively minor. He also meets Abe Foxman who heads up the Anti-Defamation League. After spending some time traveling the world with Foxman the filmmaker worries that while the ADL's purported purpose is to fight discrimination and bigotry in practice the group appears to be using the fear of anti-Semitism to bolster uncritical support for the state of Israel. Shamir contrasts Foxman's access to power with the struggles of embattled controversial academic Norman Finkelstein author of The Holocaust Industry and like Foxman the son of Holocaust victims. The filmmaker also travels with a group of Israeli high school students on their traditional class trip to Auschwitz. Shamir suggests that there's a danger in exposing the youngsters to this traumatic experience of the most hateful anti-Semitism just before they enter their mandatory military service. Shamir was granted unfettered access to Foxman and the ADL and the organization later issued a statement criticizing Shamir and the film., Yoav Shamir | Abraham Foxman | Norman Finkelstein, The Red Chapel | Blood in the Face | Sicko | Runaway Slave | Wall | Our Brand Is Crisis

As if the failure of his longtime marriage wasn't enough for Larry Gopnik (Tony-nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) to contend with now his socially inept brother refuses to move out of the house as well. Larry is a modest man of science. Up to this point his life has been uneventful at best but things are about to get interesting. When his wife Judith announces that she is leaving him to move in with his smug colleague Sy Ableman Larry does his best to contend with his failed marriage while barely tolerating his unemployable brother Arthur who appears to have grown roots on Larry's couch. Meanwhile Larry's son Danny is getting into trouble at Hebrew school and his daughter Sarah is stealthily snatching money from his wallet so she can afford a nose job. As Judith and Sy merrily begin making plans for their new life of domestic bliss together Larry begins receiving a series of anonymous letters from someone who seems intent on sabotaging his chance for tenure at the university. To further complicate matters a graduate student with failing grades is attempting to bribe the professor while simultaneously threatening him with a defamation lawsuit. Larry is in some serious need of equilibrium though it's hard to focus on getting your life in order when your beautiful neighbor insists on sunbathing in the nude just outside your window.

Barnes was a man who through hard work and determination became a doctor and medical researcher founding a successful pharmaceutical firm that made him a multimillionaire. As his fortune grew Barnes developed a taste for art and in time assembled one of the world's most remarkable private collections featuring original paintings by Van Gogh Renoir Picasso Cézanne and many other important artists. Barnes relied on his own instincts rather than the advice of experts when he bought paintings and he had little use for the pretentious attitudes of Philadelphia's art collectors and high society; the animosity between Barnes and the city's art establishment grew to the point that in 1922 he opened the Barnes Foundation a private gallery where he kept his collection rather than share it with institutions such as the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Barnes Foundation was open by invitation only and the doctor preferred to have his collection seen by students and serious art lovers rather than those he felt didn't appreciate the work. Barnes died in 1951 and made strict provisions in his will that his collection was not to be sold lent to other museums or removed from the grounds of the Barnes Foundation. Lincoln University a traditionally African-American college was appointed to oversee the foundation's collection. But after the death of Barnes' protégée Violette de Mazia in 1988 Lincoln University's trustees took full control of the collection now estimated to be worth 25 billion dollars and a number of individuals and organizations inexperienced in the world of art laid hands upon the Barnes archive. The Art of the Steal is a documentary by Don Argott that explores how greed political power and good intentions colluded to violate Albert C. Barnes' wishes and scatter his collection across the globe. The Art of the Steal was an official selection at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival., Julian Bond | David d'Arcy | Tom L.

"Female sexual dysfunction" is roughly defined as a woman's lack of desire for sexual contact and/or her inability to have an orgasm and after Viagra made treating male impotence into a growth industry a number of pharmaceutical firms are working to formulate a similar drug for women. But is "female sexual dysfunction" a real medical condition? Research has determined that 70 percent of women don't regularly reach orgasm through intercourse (usually due to inattention by their partners) and a lack of enthusiasm for lovemaking can stem from anything from a bad day at work to a husband's bad breath. Are drug companies attempting to convince women they need treatment for a malady that doesn't actually exist? Orgasm Inc. takes a look at the disinformation that has been spread about female sexuality through the ages up to the present day including a woman who collects antique vibrators and turn-of-the-century literature on "female hysteria" as well as behind-the-scenes footage of researchers attempting to formulate a female orgasm in pill form.

Lluís Homar stars as the former Mateo Blanco a screenwriter and ex-director who changed his name to Harry Caine after losing his sight in an automobile accident. A past scandal suddenly resurfaces when the news arrives that the producer of one of Harry's old movies ("Girls and Suitcases") a corrupt stockbroker named Ernesto Martel (José Luis Gómez) has died. For mysterious reasons this makes Harry's ex-production manager Judit (Blanca Portillo) nervous; then Ernesto's son Ray X (Rubén Ochandiano) turns up and asks Harry to help him write a vindictive script to get back at his vile father. The film subsequently flashes back to the early '90s when Martel became involved with his secretary Lena (Cruz) but Mateo also began to develop feelings for her and auditioned her for "Girls and Suitcases." In response to Mateo's interest in Lena (and her burgeoning interest in him) the jealous Martel commissioned Ray to make a documentary about the making of "Girls and Suitcases" as an excuse to spy on the director and star. This enabled him to watch Mateo spiriting off with Lena right under his nose and set the stage for the wily producer's elaborate revenge against Mateo. As this synopsis suggests Almodóvar uses a tricky structure laden with flashbacks to both comment on and explain the events of the present; he also interweaves a noirish sensibility throughout the picture that marks something of a first for this director., Blanca Portillo | Ruben Ochandiano | Tamar Novas | Ángela Molina | Chus Lampreave | Kiti Manver | Mariola Fuentes | Carmen Machi | Kira Miro | Alejo Sauras | Rossy de Palma, Twice Born | Bad Education | Nine | Volver | Contempt | Talk to Her

Miss G encourages her students to challenge conventional norms of the day and organizes a diving team at the school which she oversees with great interest. Miss G also sees a danger in the cliques that dominate the school and she tries to undermine them much to the annoyance of Di (Juno Temple) who holds a high place in the school's pecking order.

Fiamma is from Spain and has a strong independent streak; she doesn't look to her peers for approval and insists on doing things her own way which makes her all the more exotic and appealing to the other students.

In England the Leeds United players retain a status as the preeminent champions of their football league. Unfortunately the manager to whom the team owes much of its success visionary Don Revie (Colm Meaney) promptly leaves the unit to take over the England team. His replacement the slick and confident Brian Clough (Michael Sheen) is publicly known as a vociferous critic of the team's approach to games. Clough has some experience and success to back him up -- in flashbacks the film details how he and his business partner Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall) coached Derby County from the bottom of the Second Division to the League Championships though they had much less success working with the Brighton team later on. For various reasons Taylor refuses to accompany Clough to his new post in Leeds so Clough must go it alone. Clough wastes no time aggressively attempting to modify the playing style of the team -- he dictates that they play more attractively and less violently. This clashes with the intentions of the team members however. When the players hit the field they find it extraordinarily difficult to adapt to the mandates of their new coach which sets the stage for a series of losses and puts Clough's reputation on the line., Michael Sheen | Timothy Spall | Colm Meaney | Jim Broadbent | Henry Goodman | Maurice Roeves | Stephen Graham | Brian McCardie | Peter McDonald | Giles Anderson | Mark Bazeley | Martin Compston | Joe Dempsie | David Roper | Jimmy Reddington | Oliver Stokes | Ryan Day | Mark Cameron | Frank Skillin | Dylan Van Hoof | Sydney Wade | Elizabeth Carling | Mark Jameson | Liam Thomas | Glenn Cunningham | Tony Gubba | Gillian Waugh | Colin Harris | Stewart Robertson | Laurie Rea | Ralph Ineson | Philip Childs | Terence Harvey | Gordon Hall | Isabella Eades-Jones | Paul Bown | Christopher Chilton, Goal! | Miracle | This Sporting Life | Coach Carter | Invictus | Sunset Park

Though the BBC functioned as the country's main source of news and music its programmers offered very little airtime to rock & roll -- which left an overwhelming need unfulfilled. In response small bands of "pirate" radio enthusiasts set up broadcasting towers on boats just outside of English boundary waters and transmitted signals to an estimated 25 million listeners 24 hours a day and seven days per week. Unsurprisingly the DJs who took charge of these broadcasts could rival just about anyone in terms of flamboyance and outsized personalities. With Pirate Radio (released as The Boat That Rocked in the U.K.) writer-director Richard Curtis (Love Actually) travels back to the Swinging Sixties and takes a headfirst plunge into this colorful realm. The story opens in 1966 aboard a rusty fishing trawler christened Radio Rock and equipped with pirate broadcasting equipment. Here the slightly daft elitist Quentin (Bill Nighy) presides over a motley crew of joint-toking sex-hungry disc jockeys including Dave (Nick Frost) a heavyset boob who nevertheless considers himself a hot property with women and loves to chase skirts; "The Count" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) an American DJ who aspires to be the first person to drop an F-bomb over the British airwaves; the gloom-laden Irishman Simon (Chris O'Dowd); bonked-out hipster Thick Kevin (Tom Brooke); womanizer Mark (Tom Wisdom); Angus (Rhys Darby) a New Zealander whom nobody likes; and the only female member of the group lesbian cook Felicity (Katherine Parkinson). These misfits pull off quite a show -- enough of one that they attain the status of national idols for the youth culture -- but the super-conservative government minister Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) detests the whole business and will do almost anything in his power to shut them down., Philip Seymour Hoffman | Bill Nighy | Rhys Ifans | Nick Frost | Kenneth Branagh | January Jones | Tom Sturridge | Jack Davenport | Ralph Brown | Chris O'Dowd | Tom Brooke | Rhys Darby | Katherine Parkinson | Emma Thompson | Tom Wisdom | Talulah Riley | Gemma Arterton | Ike Hamilton | Olivia Llewellyn | Michael Hadley | Lucy Fleming | Amanda Fairbank-Hynes | Francesca Longrigg | Charlie Rowe | Sinead Matthews | Stephen Moore | Olegar Fedorov | David Sterne | Michael Thomas | William Ilkley | Ian Mercer | Gudmundur Audunsson | Tomas Andrisiunas | Kris Gummerus | Duncan Foster | Katie Lyons | Kirsty Mather | Lana Davidson | Edward Hancock | Sarah Forster | Poppy Delevingne | Ocean Moon | Tuuli Shipster, Pump up the Volume | Taking Woodstock | De rolling por Colombia | 24 Hour Party People | Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll | Almost Famous

The United Nations was established in 1945 as an international forum to promote peaceful alternatives to war defend human rights and help establish social progress and better living conditions around the globe. Today 192 nations are members of the U.N. and the organization is world-recognized with peacekeeping forces at work in many countries. So why isn't the United Nations more effective? Why are so many countries with histories of violent aggression and dismal human-rights records represented on some of the U.N.'s most important committees? How did one of the U.N.'s most publicized humanitarian programs Oil For Food become a debacle that profited the corrupt and failed to help the needy with no sanctions against those responsible? And what of incidents in which the U.N. has failed to prevent genocide waffled on cooperating with terrorists and been responsible for acts of illegal violence? Horowitz and Groff use both humor and investigative reporting to call the United Nations to task for not living up to its ideals and suggests how they could do a better job. U.N.

Lifton also pontificates on the "acculturation to killing" engendered by the camps the psychological mechanisms called "doubling" and "splitting" that turned healers into torturers and murderers and his own disturbing conviction that any man or woman could be thrust into the same sort of behavior under the right circumstances., , Forgiving Dr. Mengele | Trial of Adolf Eichmann | Gray Matter | The Specialist | The Statement | Nuremberg

Using electroshock treatment as a metaphor -- a harsh jolt to the body and brain that after being embraced as a healing method was in turn discovered to cause more harm than good -- The Shock Doctrine explores how the United States with the help of the C.I.A. became enamored of Milton Friedman's interpretation of free-market capitalism and attempted to persuade developing nations of its value. However since fully unregulated markets tended to create an unbalanced economic climate in which a small number of people became extremely wealthy and vast numbers were plunged into poverty the United States was only successful at selling free market deregulation to countries in crisis who had no practical choice than to do what the wealthiest and most powerful nation on Earth demanded. The results led to both widespread privation and violence in Russia Poland Chile South Africa and the Middle East and The Shock Doctrine explains how this happened where it's still going on and what can be done to stop it.

Olds interviewed Naqshbandi extensively trying to develop an understanding of the relationship between Western journalist and their Afghan guides/translators as part of the larger subject of the war in Afghanistan. Olds discovered a fragmented society in which corruption was so rampant that some otherwise rational Afghans Naqshbandi included began to wonder whether or not they might be better off under the iron fist of the Taliban. Six months later Naqshbandi was kidnapped by the Taliban along with the Italian journalist for whom he was working. As Olds follows the story of the kidnapping and the negotiations for the release of the hostages he exposes ineptitude and hypocrisy among government officials and a widespread (and justifiable) observation among Afghanis (including the friends and family of Naqshbandi that their lives do not seem to be worth as much to their own government as those of the Westerners among them.

At that time a handful of Disney executives were questioning the wisdom of continuing to make animated films as the company was making more money in live-action movies theme parks and television. That changed when Roy Disney -- Walt's nephew and the last figure from the studio's Golden Age management team still on board -- teamed up with newly hired studio executives Michael D. Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg to restore their reputation for both quality and commercial appeal. With the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988 the team sparked a new interest in animation on the big screen and a string of smash hits that began with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast launched a new era of both acclaim and box-office success for the company. But those successes didn't come without behind-the-scenes conflict and Don Hahn a longtime producer at Disney offers an inside look at the creative squabbles and battles amongst the management that came during Disney's climb back to the top of Hollywood's mountain in the documentary Waking Sleeping Beauty. Along with behind-the-scenes footage and rare personal artwork created by the studio's animation staff (including some unflattering cartoons of their bosses) the film includes interviews with many key figures of this era in Disney history and several people who enjoyed greater success after leaving the company such as Tim Burton and John Lasseter. Waking Sleeping Beauty was an official selection at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival., Roy Edward Disney | Michael Eisner | Jeffrey Katzenberg | Glen Keane | Don Bluth | Tim Burton | Ron Clements | Don Hahn | George Scribner | Kirk Wise | Peter Schneider | Rob Minkoff | John Musker | Roger Allers | Gary Trousdale | Thomas C.

Pierre's mother Jeanne (Tatiana Vialle) regards her sister Nadia as a poor role model primarily because of her heavy drinking and urges her son to make friends his own age. Part of Pierre's shyness around his classmates from school comes from his growing understanding of his homosexuality but he becomes more comfortable with himself after he meets another gay teen Fabrice (Manuel Marmier) and they edge into a tentative romance. However Nadia misses her frequent chats with Pierre and her fondness for liquor gives way to full-blown self-destructive alcoholism.

Brazil entered into a period of repressive politics harsh government censorship and ugly reprisals against non-conformists and critics of the government but a powerful voice of opposition came from a very unusual place. Lenny Dale was an American dancer and choreographer who had come to Brazil and fell in with a group of drag performers who had modeled themselves after the Cockettes a flamboyant group of sexual anarchists who were making a name for themselves in San Francisco. Taking the name Dzi Croquettes Dale helped transform the group into a remarkable cabaret act that used music dance outrageous costumes and provocative sexual ambiguity as a jumping off point for a satire of all that was repressive in Brazilian culture and a celebration of freedom from the confines of gender. Dzi Croquettes became wildly popular in Brazil and after Liza Minnelli championed the group they set out for a successful tour of Europe with a run on Broadway in the offering. Dzi Croquettes never made it to America and eventually ego AIDS and a string of bad luck broke up the act but for a while they were a remarkable voice of resistance and tolerance in a nation determined to beat down all opposition. Filmmakers Tatiana Issa and Raphael Alvarez chronicle the group's incredible true story in the documentary Dzi Croquettes which was a multiple award winner at the 2009 Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival as well as the 2009 Sao Paulo International Film Festival., , We Were Here | Making the Boys | Coming Out Under Fire | Outrage | Call Me Kuchu | Sex Positive

The film opens with a prologue. While they make love in their apartment on a snowy winter afternoon a husband and wife known only as "He" and "She" (Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg) fail to keep an eye on their young toddler. In a horrific turn of events the child wanders over to an open window entranced by the snow cascading down and falls two stories to his death. Von Trier then divides the remainder of the film into four chapters beginning with "Grief." In that segment the woman finishes a month's hospitalization and accuses her husband of apathy over the child's death but proceeds to take responsibility for it herself; he calmly and rationally guides her through this process. In the second segment "Pain" she confesses to him that she's most terrified of their property in the forest because she spent time with her son there over the preceding summer; as a form of therapy he takes her to that locale on a wilderness retreat. She appears to grow more calm and rational over their first days in that milieu. Yet the recovery it seems was only illusory and the subsequent two chapters "Despair (Gynocide)" and "The Three Beggars" depict the woman's shocking and abrupt regression into unbridled insanity culminating with grotesque sexual violence against herself gruesome acts of destruction against her husband and an apocalyptic climax., Willem Dafoe | Charlotte Gainsbourg, Possession | Don't Look Now | Images | Hour of the Wolf | Repulsion | Straw Dogs

The movie shows defector and former major league pitcher Luis Tiant as he returns to Cuba after over 46 years in exile and flashes back to show highlights from his remarkable pro baseball career. It also deals with Tiant's relationship with his father who was a star pitcher in Cuba and in the Negro Leagues before the revolution. Luis Tiant was playing in the States during the Bay of Pigs invasion after which the Cuban government essentially told its baseball players come home and play as amateurs or stay out forever. At the age of twenty urged on by a letter from his father Tiant made the painful decision to pursue his professional baseball career and abandon his parents his friends and his home in Cuba. Aided by the filmmakers Tiant gets permission to return to Cuba at age 67. There he finds vast changes but also many familiar sights and a surprising number of people who still remember him. The filmmakers intercut this voyage home with clips and interviews highlighting Tiant's career. Tiant was a fireballer for the Cleveland Indians in the 1960s then he broke his shoulder in 1970 playing for the Twins. He reinvented himself as a wily junkballer with a uniquely distracting delivery and achieved great success with the Boston Red Sox. The film also describes Tiant's efforts to get his parents out of Cuba so they could see him pitch.
