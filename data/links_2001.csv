A beautiful woman (Laura Elena Harring) riding in a limousine along Los Angeles' Mulholland Drive is targeted by a would-be shooter but before he can pull the trigger she is injured when her limo is hit by another car. The woman stumbles from the wreck with a head wound and in time makes her way into an apartment with no idea of where or who she is. As it turns out the apartment is home to an elderly woman who is out of town and is allowing her niece Betty (Naomi Watts) to stay there; Betty is a small-town girl from Canada who wants to be an actress and her aunt was able to arrange an audition with a film director for her. Betty befriends the injured woman who begins calling herself "Rita" after seeing a poster of Rita Hayworth. While Betty's audition impresses a casting agent and she catches the eye of hotshot director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) Kesher's producers and moneymen insist with no small vehemence that he instead cast a woman named Camilla Rhodes. As Rita attempts to put the pieces of her life back together she pulls the name Diane Selwyn from her memory; Rita thinks it could be her real name but when she and Betty find a listing for Diane Selwyn and visit her apartment they discover the latest victim of a mysterious killer who is eluding police detective Harry McKnight (Robert Forster). Rita's emotional identity soon takes a left turn and it turns out that neither woman is quite who she once appeared to be. David Lynch originally conceived Mulholland Drive as the pilot film for a television series; after the ABC television network rejected the pilot and declined to air it the French production film StudioCanal took over the project and Lynch reshot and re-edited the material into a theatrical feature. The resulting version of Mulholland Drive premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival where David Lynch shared Best Director honors with Joel Coen., Justin Theroux | Naomi Watts | Laura Elena Harring | Ann Miller | Dan Hedaya | Mark Pellegrino | Robert Forster | Katharine Towne | Lee Grant | Michael J.

Haley Joel Osment stars as David a "mecha" or robot of the future when the polar ice caps have melted and submerged many coastal cities causing worldwide starvation and human dependence upon robotic assistance. The first mecha designed to experience love David is the "son" of Henry (Sam Robards) an employee of the company that built the boy and the grief-stricken Monica (Frances O'Connor). David is meant to replace the couple's hopelessly comatose son but when their natural child recovers David is abandoned and sets out to become "a real boy" worthy of his mother's affection. Along the way David is mentored by a pleasure-providing mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and a talking "super toy" bear named Teddy. His adventures take him to the Roman Circus-style "Flesh Fair" where mechas are destroyed for the amusement of humans; Rouge City where Gigolo Joe narrowly avoids capture by police; and finally a submerged New York City where David's creator Professor Hobby (William Hurt) reveals the secrets of the boy's creation. Brendan Gleeson and narrator Ben Kingsley co-star in A.I. which was adapted from Kubrick's treatment by Spielberg in his first crack at screenwriting since Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)., Haley Joel Osment | Jude Law | Frances O'Connor | Brendan Gleeson | William Hurt | Sam Robards | Jake Thomas | Ken Leung | Michael Mantell | Michael Berresse | Kathryn Morris | Adrian Grenier | April Grace | Enrico Colantoni | Ashley Scott | Clara Bellar | Jack Angel | Robin Williams | Ben Kingsley | Meryl Streep | Chris Rock | Keith Campbell | Vito Carenzo | Clark Gregg | Jim Jansen | Lily Knight | Matt Malloy | John Prosky | R.

The film explores the lot of Afghan children who live as refugees just inside the Iranian border. While children are shown playing or studying on camera a narrator explains their situation. War famine and drought have left many of these children with no education. Even before the Taliban regime a large majority of Afghans boys and girls did not have access to education. But an effort is being made in the refugee camps to provide schooling. As we see the boys engaged in religious study the filmmaker questions them about the nature of God. They answer nervously as they think they are supposed to. Children who do not have proper identification are not allowed to attend classes so they sit outside the tiny schoolhouse and listen. In the last part of the film a girls' class is shown. The teacher a woman tries to get one girl Samira to remove her burqa and wash her face as part of a classroom demonstration. When the girl refuses citing religious reasons the teacher tells her that its pointless for her to be in the class because she cannot participate with the burqa covering her entire face including her eyes. Samira tearfully leaves the classroom. A classmate follows her out and tries to persuade her to return and participate but Samira explains that her late father was a mullah and it would desecrate his memory to show her face to the class. A song plays on the film's soundtrack with the lyrics "If only Afghan girls were born somewhere else." The film was made to benefit the Afgan Children Education Movement.

The 100-minute film gives Irish folklore a new character type a seal that becomes a lovely human enchantress. The strange metamorphosis takes place after nine days of high tide create a mysterious "seventh stream" allowing the seal to go ashore and step out of her skin. From the outset it seems clear that the sea-born beauty (Saffron Burrows) is meant for Owen Quinn (Scott Glenn) a fisherman who continues to lament the death of his wife five years after he buried her. However villainous Thomas Dunhill (John Lynch) steals the sealskin and hides it. According to folk tales handed down over generations whoever possesses the skin of a seal woman becomes her master. In addition he reaps the benefits of the good luck she brings--in whopping catches of fish. Dunhill's father (Joseph Kelly) a wise old blind man knows all about the myth of seal women. He also knows his son is a scoundrel. One day he moves the sealskin to Quinn's property. Soon thereafter the woman shows up at Quinn's doorstep and he names her Mairead and falls in love with her--and she with him. But there are complications. Mrs. Gourdon (Fiona Shaw) a local shopkeeper has set her cap for Quinn. Also Thomas Dunhill has been murdered and Quinn is a suspect.

But that began to change with the emerge of the Z-Boys a team of teenaged skateboarders who emerged from a decaying urban community in Santa Monica CA. Hard-core surfers who sought to translate the hot-dogging stunts of world-class wave riders onto their skateboards began hanging out at the Zephyr Productions Surf Shop a store that stocked top-grade equipment for local surfers and skaters and with the help of the store's owner Jeff Ho twelve of the skaters organized themselves into a team to compete at local skate events. Soon the radical moves and scruffy-streetwise style of the Zephyr Skate Team -- the Z-Boys for short -- upended public preconceptions of skateboarding as a sport and a lifestyle and the wild style of Z-Boy skaters such as Tony Alva Jim Muir and Jay Adams made them celebrities who blazed the trail for the extreme sports movement. But while the Z-Boys' success brought them a measure of fame and fortune -- lucrative endorsement contracts deals to manufacture their own custom skateboards and even movie roles (Tony Alva starred opposite Leif Garrett in Skateboard while Z-Boy Stacy Peralta was top-billed in Freewheelin') -- their fame proved to be fleeting and several of the Z-Boys fell prey to drugs crime and ego. Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary by former Z-Boy Stacy Peralta that chronicles the glory days of the Z-Boys through footage of the skaters in their prime and interviews with the pioneers of the Southern California skate scene.

Major Steve Arnold (Harvey Keitel) has been told by his superiors that they want Furtwängler convicted of being a willing participant in the crimes of the Hitler regime by virtue of his supposed support for and support from the Hitler government. They haven't got the time or resources to go after every ex-Nazi so they want Furtwängler as the biggest cultural target they can hit. Arnold does his loud boorish best to first humiliate and then attack the conductor over the supposed favoritism that he was shown by Hitler Goering Himmler et al. and his conducting of a concert at the 1934 Nuremberg rally and at Hitler's 53rd birthday. Arnold finds to his eventual distress but not dissuasion that nothing is as simple as he would like to make it. His civilian secretary Emmi Straube (Birgit Minichmayr) a concentration camp survivor whose father was part of the German Army plot to kill Hitler and Lt. David Wills (Moritz Bleibtreu) a German-born Jew representing the War Crimes Tribunal keep trying to remind Arnold that life and politics in Germany only deteriorated gradually after 1933 and in ways that couldn't always be anticipated by those who were there. Germans who chose not to leave weren't necessarily casting their lot with Hitler but with protecting what was decent or even great about Germany including her orchestras and music. Arnold knows nothing about music and even less about Germany and her people and won't be deterred from his goal. Wills and Straube wish to resign from working with him until they realize that they're facing the same choice that Furtwängler faced -- to leave a horrendous situation and have no way of affecting its conduct or outcome or remain and do their best to stand up for decency and truth. In the process of doing that they find out that Furtwängler is not only a great artist -- which they knew already -- but a great and brave man who also has his flaws.

The film opens by quickly introducing the three leads -- Lila (Patricia Arquette) who is locked away in prison; Puff (Rhys Ifans) who is testifying before Congress; and Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins) who is sitting in a glowing white afterlife waiting room with a bullet hole in his head. Rewinding to the beginning of the story the film shows Lila as a girl about to enter womanhood. Unfortunately puberty goes horribly awry and she starts to grow thick hair all over her body. After performing as Queen Kong in a circus freak show she chucks it all and goes to live in the forest where she becomes the best-selling author of a misanthropic hard-line ecological tome. At age 30 her itch for male companionship becomes overwhelming and she ventures back into the city. She is helped by electrolysis guru Louise (Rosie Perez) who not only makes Lila presentable to society but introduces her to Nathan a 35-year-old virgin who as a scientist has devoted his life to teaching table etiquette to lab mice. While showing Nathan the joys of the wild outdoors Lila and her new beau discover an extremely hirsute feral man whom they dub Puff. Placing him a cage in his lab Nathan sets out to teach Puff the ways of polite society while dreaming of fame and fortune. The first task is to curb Puff's enormous sexual appetite -- any time he catches sight of a female Puff either tries to hump her or masturbates vigorously. Nathan yokes him with an electric collar that shocks him any time he acts unseemly. Unfortunately the humans on the other side of the cage can't quite control their libidos either: Nathan succumbs to the incessant double entendres of his saucy French assistant Gabrielle (Miranda Otto) while Lila finds an animalistic lust for Nathan's science experiment.

One day Fausto finds himself so overwhelmed with his wildly stressful career that be begins pondering suicide as he waits for a train only to be interrupted by Julia who brings him the briefcase he left at his office. After boarding his train the distraught Faust encounters Santos Vella (Eduard Fernandez) who introduces himself as one of Fausto's former patients; after Fausto removed his stomach and informed him that he had but three months to live Vella opted to stop seeing doctors and ignore their advice -- and he says he's been feeling fine ever since. Despite Vella's contemptuous attitude towards modern medicine he is both friendly and grateful to Fausto and insists on giving the doctor a ride after a taxi breakdown leaves Fausto stranded. From then on Fausto finds he can't get rid of his new friend no matter how hard he tries -- everywhere he goes Vella is close behind and when Faust declares that he needs female companionship instead Vella arranges for Fausto to spend the evening with Marta (Irene Montala) a prostitute who proves to be similarly unavoidable.

To be sure the ineffable insufferable Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (here played by Alfred Molina) uses his own "little grey cells" to solve the train-compartment murder of a ruthless American business executive (Peter Strauss). This time around however Poirot is not averse to relying upon computer technology to speed up his investigation; in the same vein the murder victim has been updated (or perhaps upgraded) from an industrialist to a software tycoon. Still Christie's surprise ending (which should be no surprise at all to fans of the 1974 film) remains intact as does Poirot's ultimate decision to let his heart rule his head.

Harris' experiences with Groovin' Gary inspired three different short subjects and The Beaver Trilogy collects Harris' three Groovin' Gary films into one feature presentation. In 1979's The Beaver Kid viewers are introduced to Groovin' Gary the self-proclaimed "Rich Little of Beaver" as he shows off his car (named after Farrah Fawcett) does impressions and plugs a talent show in which he'll be appearing. Gary's act turns out to be a full-drag (and painfully sincere) impersonation of Olivia Newton-John performing "Please Don't Keep Me Waitin'." Two years later Harris made The Beaver Kid 2 essentially a satiric recreation of the first film with Sean Penn (who had then only recently scored his first film role) playing Groovin' Larry (the real Gary had since chosen to distance himself from Harris and his documentary). Finally 1985's The Orkly Kid features Crispin Glover (who later starred in Harris' Rubin and Ed) as Larry an aspiring comic and entertainer from Orkly IA who bears a certain resemblance to Groovin' Gary. Larry feels he has a gift and a message he wants to share with the world but his fellow citizens of Orkly aren't so sure they're ready for Larry's Olivia Newton-John tribute eventually leading Larry to move on to the big city in hopes of making his dreams come true. Both The Beaver Kid and The Beaver Kid 2 were produced on color video (the latter on a reported budget of only one hundred bucks) while The Orkly Kid was filmed in 16 mm with the support of the American Film Institute; the three shorts were transferred to 35 mm film for their release as The Beaver Trilogy., Sean Penn | Crispin Glover | Stefan Arngrim | John Bluto | Ken Butler | Shane McCabe | Elizabeth Daily, American Movie | Waiting for Guffman | My Life With Morrissey | Heavy Metal Parking Lot | Britney Baby One More Time! | Hedwig and the Angry Inch

A companion piece to his earlier documentary series A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies Il Mio Viaggio In Italia offers Scorsese's perspective on Italian film of the past chronicling the influence and impact it had on him as well as the rest of the world. From historical epics like Cabiria (1914) and Fabiola (1949) through neo-realist masterpieces such as Roma Città Aperta (1945) and Ladri di Biciclette (1948) to the masterworks of Luchino Visconti Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni Scorsese offers a knowledgeable take on Italian filmmaking offering background on the artists who made the films as well as a perspective on what made these films so special (analyzing their importance both as art and as social and political documents of their place and time). Il Mio Viaggio In Italia was originally produced as a series for Italian television and given a special screening at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival; Scorsese announced at the time that he planned a companion film that would follow his interest in Italian cinema up to the present investigating a number of lesser-known filmmakers., Martin Scorsese, A Letter to Elia | Italianamerican | American Boy | Luchino Visconti: A Portrait | Visions of Light: The Art of Cinematography | Two in the Wave

Hermocrates also has a retiring spinster sister Leontine (Fiona Shaw of Harry Potter) who conducts science experiments in her spare time. The princess accompanied by her faithful handmaiden Hermidas (Rachael Stirling the daughter of actress Diana Rigg) disguises herself as a male philosophy student Phocion in order to infiltrate Hermocrates' household.

The second shooter was then killed for the same reason and ever since the two clans have been trading off murders in the name of familial honor and justice. The Breveses who are a much smaller family have been suffering a great deal more than their rivals thanks to this feud; a steady drop in sugar prices has also left the family with little but their pride. When Inácio the first-born son of the Breves family is shot down his father (José Dumont) orders his next-oldest son Tonho (Rodrigo Santoro) to kill one of the Ferreira boys after the traditional month-long waiting period. Tonho finds himself questioning the wisdom of this bloody rivalry and he ponders his fate while spending time with his younger brother (Ravi Ramos Lacerda) whom his parents never bothered to name.

In recalling the horrendous torture-murder of 21-year-old Matthew Shepard near Laramie WY in 1998 the film focuses as much on the twisted logic and motivations of Matthew's killers Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney as it does on the victim and the crime. Cy Carter stars as the unfortunate Shepard with Ian Somerhelder and Brendan Fletcher respectively cast as Henderson and McKinney. Filmed in Alberta Anatomy of a Hate Crime was originally bookended by a marathon recital of recent examples of sexual and racial persecution delivered by an impressive list of unseen celebrities.

Graham (Paul Rudd) and Rex (Romany Malco) are about as different as two brothers can get -- Graham is sloppy lackadaisical and in a state of puzzled wonderment about the world around him while Rex (his real name is Alan but he thinks Rex sounds better) is a tightly focused aspiring e-commerce tycoon. Graham and Rex also don't look much like brothers; Rex is adopted which explains why he's black and Graham isn't. Graham and Rex don't see much of each other but when a distant relative passes on and bequeaths them joint ownership of a home in the South of France they fly out together to take a look at their new property. Graham and Rex discover that the estate is in dire need of repair and that the house's domestic staff -- butler Jean (Didier Flamand) cook Sabrine (Maria Verdi) caretaker Pierre (Philippe Mahon) and pretty maid Isabelle (Sylvie Testud) -- is still on hand and expecting to be kept on. Graham magnanimously promises the staff that they'll still have their jobs but Rex discovers that the previous owner was deep in debt and the only way to pay off the bills is to sell the place. So now they have to find a buyer who is willing to take the employees along with the home none of which is helped by the fact that both Graham and Rex are vying for the attentions of Isabelle.

Heath Ledger stars as William Thatcher a low-born 14th century squire who in a fit of inspired spontaneity replaces his deceased employer as the competitor at a jousting competition. Jousting is a pastime only permitted to knights who are of noble birth but Thatcher wins and decides to continue his new pursuits. With the help of his two fellow squire friends Wat and Roland (Alan Tudyk and Mark Addy) and none other than the gambling-addicted Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) Thatcher has soon adopted a false identity and is winning one joust after another on his way to a championship in London. His victories inspire the affection of a female fan Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) and the ire of a competitor Count Adehmar (Rufus Sewell) but Thatcher's ruse is threatened with exposure. A Knight's Tale is the sophomore directorial effort of acclaimed screenwriter Brian Helgeland who won an Oscar for his work on L.A. Confidential (1997) and debuted behind the camera with the troubled production of Payback (1999)., Heath Ledger | Mark Addy | Rufus Sewell | Paul Bettany | Shannyn Sossamon | Alan Tudyk | Laura Fraser | Christopher Cazenove | Bérénice Bejo | James Purefoy | Olivia Williams, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves | Excalibur | Black Knight | First Knight | The Musketeer | Plunkett & Macleane

However his often cranky sweetheart thinks he runs a hotel and Zhao is trying to keep the illusion alive with the help of his pal Li (Li Xuejian) by turning an abandoned bus into a "love hotel" for couples who lack privacy in their homes. But business isn't all that good since the old-fashioned Zhao asks unmarried couples to keep their doors open to ensure nothing untoward happens. As Zhao tries to convince his girlfriend to walk down the aisle with him -- and struggles to raise the money she demands first -- she introduces him to Wu Jing (Dong Jie) the blind teenage stepdaughter she inherited from her marriage to her now-deceased first husband. The woman insists that Zhao give Wu Jing a job in his hotel; since the bus/hotel has been towed away this isn't a practical possibility. Zhao and Li put Wu Jing through a fake job interview to keep up appearances and when she breaks down in tears talking about her deadbeat father he decides he has to do something for her. Zhao moves Wu Jing into his home and with the help of his friends sets up a phony massage therapy center where Wu Jing works with the "clients" -- actually Zhao's friends most of whom are also unemployed.

Snyder was working on Jodie Foster's Home for the Holidays when she was struck with a painful and debilitating illness. Snyder eventually learned that she had what has come to be known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. As Snyder began to recover she was inspired to make this documentary I Remember Me which encompasses her own experience with CFS the experiences of others the unexamined history of the condition and the bewilderingly dismissive response of the medical community. Snyder begins by looking at the first recorded outbreak of the illness which took place in Lake Tahoe NV in the mid-'80s. She shows brief interviews with people from the area including sufferers (some of whom have still not recovered) local doctors and public relations-types who are eager to dismiss the condition as hypochondria -- to downplay its seriousness in order to alleviate fears and protect the reputation of their resort town. Snyder exposes the CDC's failure to investigate the syndrome thoroughly. The CDC came up with the name "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" naming a complex and serious condition after one of its symptoms which one sufferer complains is akin to calling tuberculosis "Coughing Disease." Snyder also investigates earlier unrecognized outbreaks from around the world including one epidemic in Florida which occurred decades ago. Snyder tracks down survivors and doctors from this outbreak and interviews them about their experience. The heart of Snyder's documentary is her in-depth interviews with sufferers of CFS -- including filmmaker Blake Edwards (The Pink Panther) Olympic gold medallist soccer star Michelle Akers and a young man named Steven -- bedridden for two years because of the illness -- who Snyder captures attending his high school graduation., Michelle Akers, Stevie | So Much So Fast | The Forgetting: A Portrait of Alzheimer's | The Horse Boy | Mojados: Through the Night | Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train

However O'Riley has other more aggressive ways of boosting his bottom line; Centabank has been shutting down small-town branch offices that have been faithfully serving customers for decades and has developed a new enthusiasm for foreclosing on loans from smaller customers having trouble making ends meet. Two such customers are Wayne and Diane Davis (Steve Rodgers and Mandy McElhinney) who obtained a loan to start their own business building houseboats; when the local economy went into a nosedive the Davises found themselves under the thumb of Centabank and the bank's hounding of the couple led to an unfortunate accident that took the life of their young son. Determined to make Centabank pay for their son's death Wayne takes on the corporation with the help of Stephen (Mitchell Buell) an activist lawyer. Jim meanwhile becomes romantically involved with Michelle (Sibylla Budd) a Centabank employee and through her gets a clearer idea of just what O'Riley is trying to do., David Wenham | Anthony LaPaglia | Mitchell Butel | Kazuhiro Muroyama | Stephen Leeder | Bruce Myles | Vince Gil | Sibylla Budd, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps | Margin Call | Boiler Room | Purpose | Money | Patterns

In a small Indian community political control is slowly beginning to shift from a long-established monarchy to democratically elected officials and as the fondly regarded Lord K. (Krishna Kaimal) hands the reigns of power over to his newly elected successor (Sudhas Thayat) as a symbolic gesture the departing Lord gives his pet dog Apu to Koran (Thomas) an elderly man who will look after the animal with his wife.

It also turns out that Apu does not play well with others and after the dog attacks a neighbor's livestock and hurts a young boy both Koran and the dog find themselves before a judge leading to an unpleasant confrontation between the departed Lord K. and the community's new leader.

In Australia colleges and universities have traditionally been financed by the federal government and a call for tighter educational budgets has been tied to the cause of economic rationalism -- the notion that since the arts and humanities aren't "practical" or directly lead to traditional jobs in the private sector they should be at the bottom of the list of educational priorities. When rationalists decided to cut the budget of the University of Sydney's music department the University's teacher's union planned to formally protest the decision and Boyd was among the first to oppose the union's actions calling them "undignified." Over the course of a year after seeing her department's budget slashed by 70000 dollars her teaching schedule boosted from six to 20 hours a week and the failure of private institutions to step forward to support one of the nation's best respected music schools Boyd made a surprising transformation from a political conservative to an active instigator of protests against further budget cuts that would "dumb down" higher education and eliminate arts education. However as Boyd began to rally support for the University's school of music their budget was further slashed forcing her to resign the post that meant so much to her. Documentary filmmakers Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson were on hand to capture this tumultuous year in Anne Boyd's life on film and Facing the Music is the feature-length Documentary that was their result. Produced for Australian television the film earned enthusiastic reviews in its screenings at several film festivals including the 2001 Sydney Film Festival., , American Teacher | High School | Black Harvest | Rats in the Ranks | Another State of Mind | Born on the Fourth of July

The hairshirt a rough garment worn about the torso or the loins has been adopted by members of religious orders and especially devout lay people since Biblical times to express mourning or to mortify the flesh. The goal is to help the wearer resist sensual temptation and focus on the life of the spirit. Usually hidden from view lest it inspire pride in the wearer the garment is fashioned of goat's hair -- or in centuries past even fine wire. It causes sensations ranging from severe discomfort to agony every moment that it's worn. In the case of director Maciej Adamek's documentary subject who wears her hairshirt beneath her clothing but literally never removes it that has meant 56 years of constant pain. As the cameras follow the woman through her quiet daily life Every Day More Closely to Heaven examines the traumatic early experiences that led to her voluntary agony and the cultural and political ramifications of her quietly defiant spirituality.

It's a few days before Christmas and a Latin American couple living on the city's Upper East Side (Lillo Brancato Jr. and Drea de Matteo) are watching their daughter (Lisa Valens) perform in her school's holiday pageant. Afterward the couple drop the child off with a babysitter and set out to run some errands. They have two items on their agenda: get their daughter the doll she's been asking for (a nearly impossible task since the toy has become the must-have item of the season) then head to their work space uptown where they prepare and package heroin for street distribution. While the wife has her qualms about the ethics of drug dealing both she and her husband know there's plenty of money to be made in heroin -- more than most Hispanic immigrants could make working legitimate jobs in New York -- and the business has been highly lucrative for them. The couple discovers one of their lower-level dealers may be talking to the police but they soon have a bigger problem to deal with when the husband is lured to the Bronx by a fence who can get him the toy he's been looking for. The husband finds he's been lured into a trap and a kidnapper (Ice-T) gives the wife less than a half hour to collect and pay a huge ransom or her husband will be killed. As in Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant the audience never learns the names of most of the major characters in 'R Xmas; also like Bad Lieutenant (as well as King of New York and The New Rose Hotel) Ferrara invited pioneering gangster rapper Schooly-D to contribute to the film's score., Drea de Matteo | Lillo Brancato Jr. | Ice-T | Victor Argo, Traffic | Drugstore Cowboy | The Blackout | I Mobster | The French Connection | Collateral

At the film's outset Michi (Kumiko Aso) and her cohorts at a rooftop nursery cannot get ahold of their co-worker Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) who has an important floppy disk. When she ventures over to his apartment she finds him pale listless and unusually quiet -- that is until he suddenly hangs himself. While the suicide is disconcerting what really freaks Michi out is that Taguchi's body seems to dissolve into the wall leaving a sickly black stain. Meanwhile college slacker Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) logs onto the Internet for the first time even though he is not particularly fond of computers. Instead of stumbling into a porn site or a chat room he finds himself in a most peculiar site -- he just sees ghostly images of other people going about their everyday life. Then the computer prompts him asking "Would you like to meet ghosts?" Even though he eventually pulls the plug the machine still on occasion springs to life. He eventually consults a comely computer maven named Harue (Koyuki) who is also utterly baffled. As more and more Internet users seal themselves into their rooms with red duct tape and melt into black splotches Kawashima and Michi independently come to discover that the Internet has become portal for an increasingly crowded afterlife. As Tokyo becomes increasingly depopulated Kawashima and Michi cross paths.

The common anime practice of combining amazingly rendered backdrops and more traditionally hand-drawn characters continues here though with such nuances as beautifully flowing hair and soulfully expressive faces it becomes obvious that painstaking detail was paid to making the characters both visually and emotionally involving. However as expressive as some of the central characters may be it's the elaborate tri-level industrial labyrinth that encompasses the world of Metropolis that forms the film's central character and it is a kalidescopic animated marvel to behold. Director Rintaro's beautifully composed visual design is so awe-inspiringly colorful and complex that from the opening frames the viewer is fully absorbed in the environment with plot and characterization almost coming as an afterthought. And that is precisely where the film's ultimately forgivable main weakness lies. In between scenes of wide-eyed jaw-dropping visuals the story of human and android tension set against the backdrop of a futuristic city borrows from so many sources that it borders on cliché. Thankfully writer Tezuka's characters are given a depth and sense of purpose that while not altogether unconvincing or original consistently connect with the viewer's sense of recognition and sympathy. Viewers will no doubt attest that Metropolis works almost flawlessly on a purely visual and asthetic level within the opening frames of the film. Thankfully Tezuka's storytelling skills compliment that on a level which while not entirely new or original is at the very least genuinely sincere and thoughtful., , Ghost in the Shell | Memories | Appleseed | Paprika | Princess Mononoke | The Sky Crawlers

As a founder of the influential Nuyorican Poets Cafe his poetry soon became recognized as a forerunner to rap and hip-hop music. TV screenwriter turned director Leon Ichaso spins this impressionistic biographical look at this artist. Raised in an abusive family Pinero (Benjamin Bratt) turns to streets for solace. Soon he is engaging in petty crime drug dealing and addiction. When he finds himself in Sing-Sing he turns his experiences in prison into the play Short Eyes which eventually garners him seven Tony awards in 1974. Uncomfortable with his new fame he clings to his girlfriend Sugar (Talisa Soto) and his childhood buddy Miguel Algarin (Giancarlo Esposito) who is a literature professor and who co-founded the Nuyorican Cafe.

Always fascinated with fashion and the expressive possibilities of clothing Bowery quickly became a noted figure in London's image-obsessed "New Romantic" scene where (as Marcus Bracewell put it) "getting ready [to go out] became an art form." While Bowery's elaborate creations were striking Bowery designed clothing as an art form rather than as salable fashion items -- creating costumes for theater pieces performance art pieces or his own appearances at clubs Bowery used clothing to confront confuse and challenge those around him rather than to simply adorn the body. Bowery later expanded on his philosophy and approach with his own nightclub Taboo and a musical group Minty. Bowery died of AIDS-related illnesses in 1994 but this documentary -- which features interviews with his friends family and colleagues including Boy George who has since staged a musical based in part on Bowery's life -- examines his life and times as well as the lasting impact of his work.

However when Neicy discovers she's pregnant she begins to think that a less risky occupation might be in order after all; her boss at the department store thinks enough of her work to suggest a career in design and is even willing to give her a better paying job in New York. But Neicy has never gotten much affection from her mother (Lonette McKee) and wants to do something to prove her love; when she sees her mother admiring a beautiful and very expensive necklace Niecy decides to steal it as a gift for her. However the jewelry store in question has much better security than the shops Neicy is used to and she's forced to bring an outside accomplice into the picture -- Christian (Todd Williams) a jewel thief whose demands involve more than just money.

Zishe (Jouko Ahola) is a Polish Jew and a blacksmith's son who lives in a small town in Finland. A giant of a man with remarkable physical strength Zishe is discovered by Landwehr (Gustav Peter Wohler) a theatrical agent who believes a successful nightclub act can be built around this Polish Adonis. Landwehr brings Zishe to Berlin where he lands a spot in the revue of a nightclub run by Hanussen (Tim Roth) a stage hypnotist who claims to be a Danish nobleman with psychic gifts. Hanussen is also a confirmed anti-Semite who is in cahoots with many of the leading members of the Nazi Party who are becoming a political force to be reckoned with. Zishe's act in which he performs feats of strength while costumed as a Roman soldier becomes a great success but when he falls for Marta (Anna Gourari) a pianist at the club he discovers he has a rival for her affection -- Hanussen who is her lover but is also physically abusive toward her. One night while performing for an audience comprised of Hanussen's Nazi friends Zishe reveals to the crowd that he is actually a Jew. He soon becomes a champion of the Jewish cause and a hero to his fellow Poles but earns the wrath of Hanussen and his comrades in the process. As he has often done in the past Werner Herzog aimed for realism in his casting for Invincible; Jouko Ahola who plays the Polish strongman is actually a champion weightlifter from Poland while Anna Gourari is known to music aficionados as a gifted concert pianist., Tim Roth | Jouko Ahola | Anna Gourari | Max Raab | Jacob Wein | Gustav Peter Wohler | Udo Kier | Herbert Golder | Tina Bordhin | Alexander Duda | Hark Bohm, Angi Vera | Die Bleierne Zeit | Lili Marleen | All the President's Men | Trumbo | Patton

In 1940 war rages throughout Europe but the fighting has yet to arrive on the Greek island of Cephallonia where life continues to follow its own slow deliberate path until word arrives that Italian troops have invaded neighboring Albania. A wave of anti-Axis patriotism sweeps the island and Mandras (Christian Bale) a local fisherman is one of a handful of men who volunteer for the army leaving behind his aging mother (Irene Papas) and the woman he loves Pelagia (Penélope Cruz) the daughter of the island's physician Dr. Iannis (John Hurt). The timing of Mandras and his compatriots proves less than fortuitous as Italian troops invade Greece in their absence but the remaining leaders of the island issue an ultimatum -- the people of Cephallonia will surrender but only to a ranking German officer. Since none of the available German officers can speak a word of Greek an Italian soldier fluent in the language Capt. Antonio Corelli (Nicholas Cage) is sent in to serve as translator. Corelli stays on with the Greek occupation forces and he soon finds himself falling in love with beautiful Pelagia who believes that Mandras was killed in the fighting in Albania. But as romance slowly blooms between the Italian soldier and the Greek girl Mandras and a handful of surviving soldiers have joined a guerilla resistance faction and they join up with Allied forces in a bid to retake Greece; soon Pelagia must choose between the two men she loves as the Greeks battle both the Italian occupation troops and German soldiers who have been sent in to replace them.

Based on a 1953 short story by Philip K. Dick the film shares that schizophrenic author's long-running obsessions with concealed identity and humanity's potential inferiority to alternative life forms. Gary Sinise stars as Spencer John Olham a respected government scientist in the year 2079 trying to devise a secret weapon that will help his fellow humans win a decade-long war with invading aliens that are cloning human subjects and using the replicas as walking time bombs. Suddenly Olham is accused of being an alien spy and a nationwide manhunt to capture him ensues. With even his doctor wife (Madeleine Stowe) unsure that she can trust him Olham must uncover the truth on his own even as he's relentlessly pursued by Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio) a federal agent charged with destroying the clones. Imposter has a complicated history originally produced in early 2000 as a 30-minute short to be included in an anthology entitled "The Light Years Trilogy" a project that never got off the ground. So impressed was Dimension Films with the completed piece however that the footage was incorporated into a new feature version. That film was then shuffled around the release schedule for more than a year as effects were completed reshoots were ordered and the film was recut for a PG-13 rating instead of its original R.

Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a young woman who had a decidedly unusual childhood; misdiagnosed with an unusual heart condition Amelie didn't attend school with other children but spent most of her time in her room where she developed a keen imagination and an active fantasy life. Her mother Amandine (Lorella Cravotta) died in a freak accident when Amelie was eight and her father Raphael (Rufus) had limited contact with her since his presence seemed to throw her heart into high gear. Despite all this Amelie has grown into a healthy and beautiful young woman who works in a cafe and has a whimsical romantic nature. When Princess Diana dies in a car wreck in the summer of 1997 Amelie is reminded that life can be fleeting and she decides it's time for her to intervene in the lives of those around her hoping to bring a bit of happiness to her neighbors and the regulars at the cafe. Amelie starts by bringing together two lonely people -- Georgette (Isabelle Nanty) a tobacconist with a severe case of hypochondria and Joseph (Dominique Pinon) an especially ill-tempered customer. When Amelie finds a box of old toys in her apartment she returns them to their former owner Mr. Bretodeau (Maurice Benichou) sending him on a reverie of childhood. Amelie befriends Dufayel (Serge Merlin) an elderly artist living nearby whose bones are so brittle thanks to a rare disease that everything in his flat must be padded for his protection. And Amelie decides someone has to step into the life of Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) a lonely adult video store clerk and part-time carnival spook-show ghost who collects pictures left behind at photo booths around Paris.

Pennebaker. Tom Herman and Kaleil Isaza Tuzman first met while they were in high school; they studied business together in college and they remained close friends after graduating often bandying about the idea of working together. In May of 1999 they made their dream a reality and opened Govworks.com a Web-based firm devoted to helping people deal more efficiently with local governments (it began as a notion to pay parking tickets online). Govworks.com soon exploded going from a one-room office with a tiny staff to over 200 employees and a bankroll of $50 million. However like many other Internet firms of their day Govworks.com was not destined to succeed and by January of 2001 the company had let nearly all its employees go and was eventually swallowed up by a larger firm with Herman and Isaza Tuzman having little to show for their efforts. Just as significantly after their initial burst of enthusiasm Herman and Isaza Tuzman found themselves locking horns as they displayed their naivete about the nuts and bolts of making an Internet start-up work; Herman's gentle nature clashed with Isaza Tuzman's all-business approach and eventually Herman was forced out of the company he had helped to found by his longtime friend.

Their work formed the basis of the national movement Scouting for All and provided the central narrative for this documentary about the BSA's ban on gays and the numerous grassroots and court challenges to that policy. Scout's Honor presents Steven as a 13-year-old collecting petition signatures at a grocery store in his hometown of Petaluma CA and again as a 15-year-old attaining the rank of Eagle Scout even after his father and his troop leader Dave Rice have watched their own political convictions put an end to their scouting careers. Director Tom Shepard intersperses the story of Rice and the Cozzas with historical footage of scouting propaganda and interviews with Tim Curran and James Dale the former scouts who waged legal battles against the Boy Scouts' gay ban a decade apart. The BSA declined to participate in Scout's Honor but interviews with parents from Cozza's troop and archival footage of Curran's debates with well-known politicians present the opposing perspective.

In May of 2000 Mary Ann Stephens a 65-year-old tourist from Georgia was shot and killed by a black assailant in Jacksonville FL. Anxious not to damage their tourist trade the Jacksonville police rushed out and picked up the first black "suspect" who happened to be available: 15-year-old Brendon Butler who at the time of his arrest was en route to a job interview. The grieving husband of of the murder victim who had glimpsed the killer from a distance was virtually coerced by the arresting officers into identifying Butler as the guilty party -- and later thanks to the strong-arm tactics of his interrogators and without benefit of counsel the boy confessed to a crime which he did not commit. Brash chain-smoking public defender Pat McGuinness sensing that the prosecution's case stank to high heaven proceeded to mount a courtroom defense for Butler which may well survive the decades as a textbook case of brilliant jurisprudence -- while the trial itself will undoubtedly forever serve as a cautionary example of the perils and pitfalls and prejudice of "swift justice."

In the summer of 1914 Adrien Fournier (Eric Caravaca) is an engineer conscripted into the French Army where he is made a lieutenant and assigned to join a group of soldiers helping to design and build a bridge to move troops near the front lines. While scouting a suitable location for the bridge Fournier and his fellows are caught in the middle of an attack and a shell explodes in his face.

It is some time before Fournier can be moved to an Army hospital and he cannot talk through his ruined mouth communicating with notes scratched onto a small chalkboard. Fournier finds himself in a special hospital wing for officers who've suffered severe injuries (a relatively comfortable area a good bit different from the crowded and spartan wards for common foot soldiers) and as a dedicated surgeon (Andre Dussollier) struggles to rebuild Fournier's face with the primitive means available to him the once-handsome engineer ponders an uncertain future. Commiserating with Fournier are Alain (Jean-Michel Portal) his best friend from college; Pierre (Gregori Derangere) and Henri (Denis Podalydes) a pair of fellow officers also suffering facial injuries; and Anais (Sabine Azema) a patient and warm-hearted nurse who brings hope to the hospital's most severely injured men.

Andrew Bovell freely adapted his play Speaking in Tongues opening up the action as the geography and topography of Sydney and its suburbs become major characters as well. The film opens with a shot of what looks like a corpse entangled in a thick stand of branches -- the title plant which grows in profusion in Australia. Bovell and director Ray Lawrence take their time in explaining whose body that is and then slowly reveal with no help from a number of red herrings how it happened to be there. The principal players are Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) a psychiatrist with issues over her child a murder victim; her husband John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) an aloof professor whom she suspects of infidelity; Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia) a police detective cheating on his wife Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) who is a patient of Valerie's. Zat's mistress Jane O'May (Rachael Blake) is someone he met at a dancing class his wife dragged him to; she is estranged from her husband Pete (Glenn L. Robbins). Their neighbors Paula (Daniela Farinacci) and Nik D'Amato (Vince Colosimo) try to stay neutral in the O'Mays' split; she works days as a nurse and he's unemployed and minds their children. Suspicion around the disappearance of one character manages to enmesh all of the others. Bovell's stories are about secrets real and imagined and how they can poison relationships.

As described in the film the soldiers believed their superiors' commands to be an articulation of the emperor's will. Blind obedience was expected; individual thought was brutally suppressed. New recruits quickly learned that the Chinese were not to be thought of as much less treated like humans. Chinese peasants were often used for bayonet and target practice. As civilian massacres became a primary means to control the countryside soldiers were ordered to murder torture rape and loot. Those who showed signs of reluctance were shunned. Meanwhile the infamous Unit No. 731 performed biological experiments and vivisections on particularly unlucky Chinese soldiers.

This program tells the story of how these trains gained popularity what it was like to ride one and why their numbers began to diminish in later years. One of the first most impressive runs occurred in May 1934 when a locomotive known as the Zephyr left Denver's Union Station on a nonstop run to Chicago. It had a long sleek body and was powered by a compact diesel engine that made it possible to cover over 1000 miles in record time. Soon dozens of these trains crisscrossed the nation making other countries envy America's transportation system. However the video shows when the '60s arrived many of these streamliners were sold to either Japan or Canada as air travel and other factors began changing people's transportation preferences., , NOVA: Supersonic Spies | NOVA: Titanic's Lost Sister | Air & Space Smithsonian: Dreams of Flight - Beyond the Moon | NOVA: Hitler's Lost Sub | NOVA: A Man A Plan A Canal Panama | NOVA: Stationed In the Stars

But Bohmer is abruptly fired from his training assignment only to be replaced by a much younger man Gasa (Paterson Joseph) who refocuses his runners in middle-distance competition. Bohmer is despondent until he discovers Christine (Nthati Moshesh) a young woman he sees jogging one day. Bohmer's trained eye tells him that she has the natural gifts and talent to win the Comrades but he learns that she's never trained for a competitive athletic event in her life -- and she's an illegal alien from Namibia to boot. After a police raid on her home Christine has little recourse but to accept Bohmer's invitation to stay with him and while he spares no expense in coaching her for the Comrades she begins to chafe under his rigorous training program; furthermore when Gasa hears about the remarkable new runner Bohmer has discovered he tries to convince her to join his team.

Ovidiu (Alexandru Papadopol) is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent who is trying to launch a business selling snack food while still living in his parent's flat in Constanta. Needing cash to get his business off the ground Ovidiu is more than willing to listen when he's approached by a local crime boss. It seems the mobster has a package that he needs delivered to Bucharest and he's willing to pay Ovidiu a healthy wad of cash to do the job. Ovidiu isn't sure what's in the package (and is smart enough not to ask) but he figures it's an easy way to make some fast money so he packs up his van and hits the road with his girlfriend (Ioana Flora) and another pal (Dragos Bucur) tagging along for company. Assuming they're carrying some sort of contraband Ovidiu and his friends have to steer clear of police cars and check points along the way but before long the law is the least of Ovidiu's worries when he discovers that a red car is following them -- and the four men inside are determined not to be shaken.

While Joseph is rushed to the hospital he never regains consciousness and dies later that day. Betty is understandably distraught and as she sinks deep in sorrow Margot snatches Jose (Alexis Chatrian) a boy the same age as Joseph who is the son of Carole (Mathilde Seigner) a waitress with a serious drug habit who often delegates care of her child to her new boyfriend Francois (Luck Mervil). Margot claims that Jose deserves a better parent than Carole and she gives him to Betty to care for; while Betty is fully aware of the impropriety of Margot's action the loss of Joseph has left such a void in her life that she reluctantly accepts the child as a way of dealing with her sadness. Betty Fisher et Autres Histoires was directed by one-time Francois Truffaut associate .,  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | , Valentin Valentin | Without a Trace | The Comedy of Innocence | The Deep End of the Ocean | Losing Isaiah | Innocent Victim

Jessica Stein (Jennifer Westfeldt) is a woman with a solid career as a copy editor but her love life isn't much to write home about; she's been through a long series of disastrous first dates that refuse to evolve into second dates and the well-intended advice of her best friend Joan (Jackie Hoffman) and former boyfriend Josh (Scott Cohen) isn't helping a bit. One day Jessica is scanning personal ads in the newspaper with her friends and she sees one with a quote from her favorite poet. Jessica reads on to discover that she has a lot in common with the person who placed the ad -- too much so since it turns out the notice is from a woman Helen Cooper (Heather Juergensen) who manages an art gallery. Jessica figures it would at least be nice to hang out with someone who shares her interests and she gives Helen a call. Jessica and Helen quickly strike up a close friendship that evolves into something more intimate though neither of them has ever been involved with another woman ... and Helen is a bit more avid about her new romantic horizons than Jessica. As their relationship progresses Jessica finds herself struggling with her feelings about her new sexual outlook and she isn't sure how to break the news about her relationship to her mother (Tovah Feldshuh) as she tries to decide if she should bring Helen along to her brother's wedding. Kissing Jessica Stein was based on the off-Broadway play Lipschtick which was written by Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen who starred in the original stage production as well as this film adaptation; the film won both the Critics' Special Jury Award and the Audience Award at the 2001 Los Angeles Film Festival., , The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love | Go Fish | Better Than Chocolate | Big Eden | All Over the Guy | Amy's O

Scott Berg's well-received biography of Samuel L. Goldwyn (1882-1974) Hollywood's first and likely still greatest independent producer. (Berg cowrote the screenplay.) Like many Hollywood pioneers Goldwyn was born in Europe in modest circumstances began his professional life in America in another business (selling gloves) and then fell into motion pictures in Goldwyn's case just as production was moving to the West Coast. His first film with partner Jessie L. Lasky was The Squaw Man directed by Cecil B. DeMille and shot on location in the newly minted community of Hollywood. Goldwyn's career was slow getting started but he hit his stride in the sound era with literary adaptations of Sinclair Lewis's Arrowsmith and Dodsworth Lillian Hellman's These Three and The Little Foxes (which Goldwyn famous for slips of speech always referred to as The Three Little Foxes) Sidney Kingsley's Dead End and Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. He also made the first two screen versions of the venerable weepie Stella Dallas produced Eddie Cantor's big foray into film Whoopee and made the iconic baseball biography Pride of the Yankees. Goldwyn finally reached the pinnacle of movie success in 1946 with The Best Years of Our Lives which brought him his first Oscar for Best Picture. His postwar career arc was largely downward; two big musicals Guys and Dolls and especially Porgy and Bess failed to capture the public attention in spite of lavish production values and big-name casts. The newly filmed interviews mostly with the surviving members of the Goldwyn family including his son Sam Goldwyn Jr. his daughter from his first marriage Ruth Capps and his actor grandson Tony Goldwyn offer insights into Goldwyn the man while excerpts from vintage interviews with Bette Davis William Wyler John Huston Rouben Mamoulian Lillian Hellman Danny Kaye Dana Andrews Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier (doing a hilarious impression of Goldwyn) offer glimpses into his working persona., , Roger Corman: Hollywood's Wild Angel | Wild Bill: Hollywood Maverick | My Voyage to Italy | Tell Them Who You Are | Klic k urcovani trpasliku aneb posledni cesta Lemuela Gulliver | A Letter to Elia

As in several of Gorey's own works the 26 letters of the alphabet are employed as a means of telling a short and somewhat gruesome story. "A was the Antiquarian who found a rare tome....B was the Bike he used to get home...." And so we follow our hapless scholar as he discovers a rare and accursed book at his local book shop see how he feebly attempts to rid himself of it and witness his untimely and unfortunate end at the hands of "The Villain". The film employs voice-over narration throughout and is styled in the mode of a silent film owing much to the structuralist films of Peter Greenaway and the 1920s-era pastiches of Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin.

But by night Gein was one of the most bizarre and dangerous psychopaths in recorded history. Raised by a violent alcoholic father and a mother with an obsessive fear of sin and hatred of sex Gein had very few friends and after the death of his parents Gein was left to his own devices on the family farm (where under a government subsidy program he was paid not to grow crops) and his unhealthy obsessions eventually became ugly realities. Gein's crimes included murder necrophilia cannibalism and grave robbing with Gein using the flesh and bones of his victims to construct household objects including a suit and mask made from human skin that Gein used when he wanted to dress up as a woman (it's been suggested that some of Gein's crimes stemmed from a twisted attempt to deal with his desire to change his gender). In 1957 two murders committed by Gein attracted the attention of the police leading to Gein's arrest; near the end of that year he was declared criminally insane and was committed for life to Wisconsin's Waupan State Hospital where he stayed until his death in 1984. Gein's grisly story inspired a number of horror films including Psycho The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deranged but Ed Gein is the first feature based strictly on the facts of Gein's case using his real name as well as those of most of his victims.

Burnett brought together a veritable who's who of American roots music for the project and while the film was a moderate success the soundtrack album to O Brother Where Art Thou? was a surprise hit topping the country charts for several weeks and helping to open the ears of a new audience to the beauty and rough-hewn poetry of bluegrass traditional country rural blues and gospel music. Shortly before the film's release Burnett assembled many of the artists who appeared on the O Brother Where Art Thou? soundtrack for a special concert at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry) to benefit the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum; the evening was filmed and Down From the Mountain documents this very special night of music that celebrates America's musical past as it points to the future.

Barnes was sentenced to death for the crime but in the nine years before he was executed a significant amount of evidence surfaced that suggested Barnes was innocent or at the very least did not receive a fair trial; even Barnes' own court-appointed attorney admitted he was incompetent in his handling of the case and that a number of key witnesses for the defense were never called to testify and experts contended that the State's evidence against Barnes was fabricated. Made in the USA is a documentary from French filmmaker Solveig Anspach that examines the Barnes case; while the filmmakers remain neutral on the issue of his ultimate guilt or innocence the film does support the argument that Barnes (like the majority of people on Texas' death row) failed to receive a fair trial or adequate legal counsel raising questions about the role of race and class in the American judicial system.

Francois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is an accountant whose personality is bland to the point of being nonexistent; he's been down in the dumps ever since his wife left him two years ago and he becomes even more depressed when he learns that his boss is planning on firing him after 20 years of loyal service. Francois is seriously considering suicide until his next-door neighbor Belone (Michel Aumont) comes up with a plan to save his career. Belone finds some photos snapped at an especially randy gay nightclub and using his computer he pastes Francois' face over that of one of the participants. He sends copies of the doctored picture to several of Francois' co-workers and soon everyone at the office is convinced the quiet little man has a flamboyant secret life. The firm's CEO Kopel (Jean Rochefort) now has second thoughts about firing Francois since letting an employee go who is known to be gay could invite a sexual discrimination suit. Meanwhile the firm's public relations man Guillaume (Thierry Lhermitte) is dealing with Felix (Gérard Depardieu) an employee relations executive who is well known as a narrow-minded thug. In order to counter charges that he's a rampant homophobe Guillaume instructs Felix to make friends with Francois and soon Felix is spending so much time with Francois (while fighting his own internal revulsion) that his wife wonders if he's seeing another woman.

When he admits to his increasingly exasperated girlfriend that he used her life savings to fund improvements for his failing diner she dumps him leaving him to fend for himself against his venal father. Meanwhile Bent (Bjorn Sundquist) is the harried drummer of Norway's hottest rock act -- the Ivar Mo Band. Bent's sole reason for existing is because of his tenuous relationship with Ivar Mo -- looking just like a mullet-headed burned-out rocker from a Behind the Music rerun (something that the loathsome star takes pleasure in reminding him of). After being humiliated after his wife decides to spend the night with Ivar rather than with him Bent exacts revenge when his hired goons kidnap Ivar and deposit him in a remote woodland cabin. Unfortunately the thugs then get into an ugly car accident and wind up in the hospital. When Jan discovers the bound and blindfolded rock star following an ill-fated suicide attempt he decides to take his life into his hands -- he stashes Ivar in his car and demands a ransom.

As Abberline and Godley investigate the neighborhood where the crimes occur they become acquainted with the prostitutes and street people who were friends and compatriots of the victims and Abberline finds himself falling in love with Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) a beautiful Irish streetwalker. As Abberline tries to identify the killer before Mary Kelly can become the next victim he and Godley have to contend with Sir Charles Warren (Ian Richardson) their superior who is keen to pin the murders on a culprit who isn't British and Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) a respected physician who has his own ideas about the murders and the benefits of psychosurgery.

While it has certain similarities to Roberto Rossellini's neo-realist classic Germany Year Zero -- taking place in what's basically a war zone -- Koci's film is a dark comedy. Koci used a cast of non-actors (including some playing characters based on themselves) and veterans of the Albanian theater. His episodic film follows Niku (Nevin Mecaj) a friendly but rather feckless young man through a few tumultuous days in 1997. Koci's focus is on the odd ways the Albanians attempt to earn a living and on the common dream of leaving Albania to achieve fantastic success in other European countries or in America. Koci has in fact referred to his film as "a call to the Albanian people not to abandon their native land." Niku is perhaps the only character in the film who willingly chooses to stay in Albania despite pressure from his pretty girlfriend Klara (Ermela Teli) to move away with her. When a sculptor offers to take Klara to Paris where he's having an exhibit she can't convince Niku to leave so she goes without him. Niku finds whatever work he can amid the chaos in the country. This usually involves the use of a rickety Chinese truck his father has given to him. At one point he drives an eccentric German man Gunter (Lars Rudolph) to the lovely Southern coast of Albania where Gunter hires him to help him transport one of the thousands of bunkers that line the coast (built by former dictator Enver Hoxha) back to Germany as a souvenir. Niku also drives around a French journalist (Laura Pelerins) who photographs a man chopping down a tree only to find herself threatened by his axe., Nevin Mecaj | Ermela Teli | Behar Mera | Lars Rudolph | Rajmonda Bulku | Robert Ndrenika | Birche Hasko | Laura Pelerins,

The story is set in the London of the near future a crime-ridden metropolis virtually torn apart by racial hostilities. By order of the Prime Minister black police officer John Othello (Eamonn Walker) is promoted to Commissioner a post dearly coveted by Othello's friend mentor and fellow officer Ben Jago (Christopher Eccleston). Seething with jealousy Jago contrives to discredit Othello in the eyes of the public and to destroy John's interracial marriage to the lily-white Dessie (Keeley Hawes). Among those used as unwitting dupes to gain Jago's ends are Othello's trusted lieutenant Michael Cass (Richard Coyle) scrupulously honest police constable Alan Roderick (Del Synnott) and Jago's own wife Lulu (Rachael Stirling). Typical of the film's modernizations is the handling of the evidence "proving" Dessie's infidelity. In place of the incriminating handkerchief in the Shakespearean original a robe is offered which has been tampered with by Jago so that the DNA lab will find evidence that Dessie has not only cuckolded Othello but also is part of a greater plan to ruin his reputation.

In ancient England Christianity is spreading and the Saxons are invading. It's up to Viviane (Anjelica Huston) -- Lady of the Lake and high priestess of the kingdom's ancient pagan religion -- to make sure that the next king will honor both the old and new faiths and thereby banish the barbarian hordes. Viviane manipulates her sister Igraine (Caroline Goodall) into marrying King Uther Pendragon (Mark Lewis Jones) and bearing a son Arthur (Edward Atterton) -- much to the consternation of Viviane's other sister the power-hungry Morgause (Joan Allen). Arthur grows up happily with his older half-sister Morgaine (Julianna Margulies) until Merlin (Michael Byrne) spirits him off for training and Viviane brings Morgaine to the mystical island of Avalon to develop her magical connection to the Goddess. Years later the siblings reunite in a masked mating ritual unaware that their union is incestuous -- or that their son Mordred (Hans Matheson) will fall into Morgause's clutches and destroy the delicate balance that Viviane has sought to maintain. As Arthur gathers the knights of the round table and ushers in a golden age with Queen Gwenhwyfar (Samantha Mathis) at his side the seeds of his destruction and Avalon's have already been planted -- by Arthur himself. Filmed on-location in Prague The Mists of Avalon premiered on the TNT cable network July 15 and 16 2001.

Jackpot is named for the town of Jackpot NV said in the film to be "just across the border" from Twin Falls. Like the Polish brothers' debut it's well shot by cinematographer M. David Mullen and is similarly full of odd deadpan humor but Jackpot has much more prosaic subject matter. Sunny Holiday (Jon Gries) abandons his wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and their child to go in delusional pursuit of a singing career. Sunny is seemingly unaware of his lack of talent as he and his stalwart manager Les (Garrett Morris of Saturday Night Live fame) travel from one town to another entering karaoke contests in dive bars. Life on the road has its short-lived rewards as desperate women occasionally fall for Sunny despite Les' efforts to keep him out of trouble. But unbeknownst to Sunny his wife is unhappy with the lottery tickets he sends her in lieu of child support and she's set a private detective on his trail. One of the first features shot using a Sony 24P digital camera (along with Session 9 and Star Wars: Episode 2) Jackpot captures a grimy life on the road with detailed close-ups and effective deep-focus imagery.

Michel Durand (Jean-Hughes Anglade) is a divorced psychiatrist in his early forties with a successful practice in Paris. One of his patients is Olga Kubler (Helene de Fougerolles) the beautiful wife of a prominent business man with a less than scrupulous past. Olga is dealing with a number of interwoven neuroses including a strong taste for painful degrading sex and a compulsive habit of stealing things. Olga has already used Durand as an alibi when questioned by the police about the theft of some valuable jewels and while Durand told the authorities that Olga was in consultation with him at the time of the robbery the truth is he's not sure where she was and imagines she's probably guilty. Durand is also afraid to admit that he's become quite bored with Olga's stories about her unconventional sexual liaisons and one day as she goes on about her favorite subject he falls asleep. A few minutes later Durand wakes up and discovers Olga is dead. Durand has no idea what happened to Olga and isn't sure what to do with the body but he's too frightened to call the police so he tries to hide her in his office. Soon Durand finds himself followed by a mysterious stranger (Miki Manojlovic) dumped by his increasingly suspicious girlfriend (Valentina Sauca) and bothered by Olga's husband (Yves Reiner) who insists the doctor find some valuables that Olga stole from him.

While Samantha objects to Jerry taking the assignment he isn't in much of a position to argue; Jerry heads south of the border while Samantha in a huff sets out for Las Vegas. Once in Mexico Jerry finds the pistol easily enough but making his way back to the States proves to be an unexpected challenge. Meanwhile Jerry's superiors want insurance that he'll return with the goods so they hire Leroy (James Gandolfini) a hitman to kidnap Samantha and hold her hostage until Jerry comes back. However Samantha and Leroy quickly strike up a friendship and she soon learns the gunman has a sensitive side he doesn't show to the world -- along with a few other secrets.

In 1938 Umberto (Diego Abatantuono) is a tailor who is beginning to lose business to Leone (Sergio Castellito) a haberdasher whose shop is next door to Umberto's. Leone offers stock much like Umberto's and at lower prices which has brought plenty of customers into his store causing Umberto no small amount of annoyance. Umberto's ire is hardly soothed by the fact that his teenage son Paolo (Elio Germano) is dating Leone's daughter Susanna (Gioia Spaziani) or that the two men's younger sons Pietruccio (Walter Dragonetti) and Lele (Simone Ascani) are best friends. The rivalry between the two shopkeepers eventually leads to a heated public argument in which Umberto refers to Leone's Jewish faith in a derogatory manner. A policeman overhears this and Leone who had previously been quiet about his Jewish heritage soon finds himself having to deal with the sanctions being levied against Jewish citizens.

His announcement clearly proved to be premature as exhibited by this bizarre romantic drama about the power of really good sex based on a book by Henmi Yo. Koji Yakusho -- who starred in Imamura's Unagi along with virtually every Japanese indie film of note in the late '90s -- is Yosuke a once successful marketing exec for an architecture film who is now out of work and separated from his wife. One of his few friends is Taro (Kazuo Kitamura) an aging bum living under a blue tarp with his collection of rare books. During one of his drunken rants Taro tells Yosuke of a golden Buddha he stole from a temple in Kyoto and stashed in a ramshackle house adjacent to a red bridge on the rugged Noto peninsula. After Taro dies Yosuke ventures to the hinterland to see if he can find the priceless statue and he finds the house which is inhabited by a senile confectionery maker (Imamura regular Mitsuko Baisho) and by her vivacious granddaughter Saeko (Misa Shimizu). Yosuke's first indication that Saeko is quite unlike the other girls is when he spies her stealing cheese from a local market. She later tells him that her body is a spring of water that wells up within her. The only means of relief is by doing something naughty -- like shoplifting -- or by engaging in a vigorous round of sex. Soon the two are enthusiastically exchanging fluids so much so that water blasts from Saeko's nether regions like a fire hose. As the water flows to the nearby creek fish cluster around to cavort in its special properties. Yosuke decides to stick around landing a job as a fisherman not only to service Saeko's special needs but also to look for the Buddha.

But each man on the crew harbors a dangerous secret and it's only a short time before the haunted atmosphere of the asylum -- where cruel and primitive means were used to control unstable patients -- begins to work its dark spell on them. Session 9 was one of the first feature films shot using Sony's 24P HD video which shoots at 24 frames per second like film as opposed to the 30 frames per second of conventional video.

Set in the 1970s during the height of the Hoxha's isolationist regime the film centers on Andre (Artur Gorishti) a young biology teacher who ventures from the capital Tirana to teach in an elementary school in the mountainous countryside. His first duty is to select an official slogan for his class. He chooses the shortest option -- "Glory to the Revolutionary Spirit" or "American Imperialism Is a Paper Tiger" -- largely because he and his class are assigned to spell out the slogan in stones on a mountainside. Unfortunately in this school where the government's ever-shifting party line is the absolute law Andre's choice in slogans proves to be against the current mood in Tirana exposing him to accusations of counter-revolutionariness. Attractive French teacher Diana (Luiza Xhuvani) quickly informs him of his error and soon romantic sparks start to fly. But Andre's imprudent choice has raised suspicions in his nervous superiors who are looking for a scapegoat in case a visit from a high-ranking party member goes poorly. This film the first Albanian film ever to be screened in the Cannes Film Festival was also screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival., Birche Hasko,
