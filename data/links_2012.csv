The film opens on a character played by director Leos Carax known only as "Le Dormeur." After waking up one morning he somehow locates and opens a secret door in his apartment and wanders into a packed movie house where an audience watches King Vidor's classic The Crowd and a giant dog wanders up and down the aisles. Meanwhile Oscar (Denis Lavant) rides to work in a white limousine driven by his close friend and associate CÃ©line (Edith Scob); Oscar's job it seems involves using makeup elaborate costumes and props to carry out a number of complex and unusual scenarios. Of these one has the actor performing an action sequence and simulated sex with an actress on a soundstage while he's filmed by an off-camera director. The second sequence puts him in a sewer with Monsieur Merde a character who first appeared in Carax's segment in the omnibus picture Tokyo!; here Merde falls in love with a beautiful model (Eva Mendes) who accompanies him on a jaunt through a cemetery. Subsequent episodes cast Oscar in a deathbed melodrama a gangster film a musical alongside pop star Kylie Minogue and much more. At one point in the picture Carax implies that Oscar may be acting these scenes out for hidden cameras which are webcasting the episodes for Internet surfers. An intriguing footnote: Movie buffs may experience some dÃ©jÃ  vu while watching Scob in this film as she's deliberately used to invoke her characterization from Georges Franju's 1960 horror classic Eyes without a Face and at one point even wears a facial mask similar to the one she donned in that picture.

In the year 2047 time travel has yet to be invented. Thirty years later however it has. Though immediately outlawed time-travel technology is quickly appropriated by the mob and used to cleanly dispose of anyone deemed a threat.

Joe Simmons (Gordon-Levitt) is one of the most respected loopers around. Each kill earns him a big payday and he's got big plans to retire to France. Then one day as Joe patiently awaits the appearance of his next target near the edge of a remote corn field he's shocked to come face-to-face with his future self (Bruce Willis). When the younger Joe hesitates the older Joe makes a daring escape. Now in order to avoid the wrath of his underworld boss (Jeff Daniels) young Joe must "close the loop" and kill his older counterpart. Meanwhile the revelation that a powerful crime boss in the future has set the underworld ablaze pits the two Joes on a violent collision course with the fate of a devoted mother (Emily Blunt) and her young son hanging in the balance.

Also appearing -- in a lengthy Seder sequence -- are friends and relatives of the Isaacs family played by Michael Emil Simon Jaglom Sabrina Jaglom and others.

However while the new drugs were effective in helping patients live with the disease they were also expensive and as AIDS began to spread through Africa India and other Third World nations claiming literally thousands of victims each day only a tiny handful of patients could afford the new medications. Cipla a major Indian pharmaceutical firm set out to address this problem by formulating an affordable generic alternative but they soon ran into a roadblock when several drug companies who owned patents on antiretroviral medicines took legal action to prevent distribution of low-cost variants on their products. The distribution of Cipla's product put life-saving drugs in the hands of ten times more patients than before but does this humanitarian effort deny another firm's right to make a profit? This battle of principle over property is examined in the documentary Fire In The Blood which also presents the story of the spread of AIDS in the Third World and profiles Zackie Achmat a South African activist who refused AIDS treatment until affordable drugs were available to all who needed them.

At the outset of the story thirteen French theater actors each receive a call informing them that the stage director Antoine d'Anthac has died. These thespians share a common thread -- all appeared previously in various productions of Jean Anouilh's play Eurydice. The players get summoned to one of d'Anthac's mansions (a trope lifted from Anouilh's Dear Antoine) where they are asked to evaluate taped versions of a new theatrical company's take on Eurydice. In the process the film begins to cut between several contrasting "visions" of the play beginning with a stripped-down warehouse-set rendition of it. Throughout several different French couples portray the doomed lovers Orpheus and Eurydice. The interpretations vie with one another for the guests' shared attention. As the performers follow the action with wide eyes they instinctively begin to repeat passages of dialogue and then physically step into green-screened scenes from the production. Among Resnais' many themes in the film is the extent of the loyalty and devotion that actors may begin to feel for a particular director; appropriately enough then many in the cast of this film had worked with Resnais on several prior occasions., , Life of Riley | Bicycling With MoliÃ¨re | Under the Rainbow | Vanya on 42nd Street | All About Eve | Fame

Fayyad sought to set aside divisiveness and instead asked Palestinians to imagine what sort of a state they would want and then take concrete steps towards making it a reality. Fayyad's campaign which he freely admitted was inspired by the program that led to the U.S.'s recognition of Israel in 1949 earned the respect of a number of international leaders and helped establish a common ground between many activists in the Middle East but the plan fell short of its goals. Filmmaker Dan Setton profiles Salam Fayyad and chronicles his efforts to bring Palestine to the United Nations in the documentary State 194.

Actual audio from the operation offers a vivid glimpse at a defining moment in history and for the first time ever Yonatan's ex-wife speaks candidly about the man behind the soldier.

Delisle intercuts five mini-narratives each spoken entirely in first-person voiceover by a different character. One is a fortysomething man (Delisle) who committed a hit-and-run tried to dispose of the body and was sent to prison; another is a down-on-his luck drug dealer with extreme facial injuries wrought by his "trade"; a third is an elderly woman heartsick over her son's incarceration and her sister's terminal illness; a fourth is a young woman still contending with a separation from her lover and attempting to start fresh; and the fifth is a prison guard juggling an emotionally trying job with family issues. As the movie rolls forward it becomes apparent that all of these individuals' lives are connected via that of the hit-and-run perpetrator. Though the movie does contain some live-action footage Delislemostly enlists a preponderance of single images (shown with the narration atop them) that have metaphoric connotations tied to the movie's stories - such as waterfalls rivers time-lapse shots of cloud banks roses and very occasionally fauna. The history of this motion picture is as unusual and unexpected as its content: it actually began as a book of photographs and evolved into a feature script as Delisle spontaneously wrote the monologues drawing some inspiration from emotional experiences and journeys in his own life., , Hiroshima Mon Amour | The Designated Mourner | 21 Grams | Magnolia | The Best Years of Our Lives | Grand Canyon

Based in the Sussex countryside Stephen Hook runs Hook & Son; his trade involves raising herds of cattle sourcing lactate from the females and selling the milk in its raw and organic state without any added preservatives. But this isn't merely a job for Stephen: he keeps on a first-name basis with each of the cows especially the farm's resident "mascot" Ida. Sadly the prospects are not great for the way of life that Hook & Son embody with an increasing number of family farms being shut down across the UK every year. The only way that Stephen his family and his colleagues manage to stay afloat is to sell directly to customers instead of working through a middle man. As Heathcote and Bachelier observe Stephen's dÃ©marche - his routine of feeding the cows healing their wounds emotionally reassuring them helping to birth their calves and much more - the film pulls us into a slow laid back and lyrical way of life that exists at odds with the technology of the surrounding world., , Heart & Soil | Beautiful Krista | Shane | Samsara | Off and Running | The Best Years of Our Lives
