The film opens on a character played by director Leos Carax known only as "Le Dormeur." After waking up one morning he somehow locates and opens a secret door in his apartment and wanders into a packed movie house where an audience watches King Vidor's classic The Crowd and a giant dog wanders up and down the aisles. Meanwhile Oscar (Denis Lavant) rides to work in a white limousine driven by his close friend and associate Céline (Edith Scob); Oscar's job it seems involves using makeup elaborate costumes and props to carry out a number of complex and unusual scenarios. Of these one has the actor performing an action sequence and simulated sex with an actress on a soundstage while he's filmed by an off-camera director. The second sequence puts him in a sewer with Monsieur Merde a character who first appeared in Carax's segment in the omnibus picture Tokyo!; here Merde falls in love with a beautiful model (Eva Mendes) who accompanies him on a jaunt through a cemetery. Subsequent episodes cast Oscar in a deathbed melodrama a gangster film a musical alongside pop star Kylie Minogue and much more. At one point in the picture Carax implies that Oscar may be acting these scenes out for hidden cameras which are webcasting the episodes for Internet surfers. An intriguing footnote: Movie buffs may experience some déjà vu while watching Scob in this film as she's deliberately used to invoke her characterization from Georges Franju's 1960 horror classic Eyes without a Face and at one point even wears a facial mask similar to the one she donned in that picture.

Joe Simmons (Gordon-Levitt) is one of the most respected loopers around. Each kill earns him a big payday and he's got big plans to retire to France. Then one day as Joe patiently awaits the appearance of his next target near the edge of a remote corn field he's shocked to come face-to-face with his future self (Bruce Willis). When the younger Joe hesitates the older Joe makes a daring escape. Now in order to avoid the wrath of his underworld boss (Jeff Daniels) young Joe must "close the loop" and kill his older counterpart. Meanwhile the revelation that a powerful crime boss in the future has set the underworld ablaze pits the two Joes on a violent collision course with the fate of a devoted mother (Emily Blunt) and her young son hanging in the balance.

Also appearing -- in a lengthy Seder sequence -- are friends and relatives of the Isaacs family played by Michael Emil Simon Jaglom Sabrina Jaglom and others.

However while the new drugs were effective in helping patients live with the disease they were also expensive and as AIDS began to spread through Africa India and other Third World nations claiming literally thousands of victims each day only a tiny handful of patients could afford the new medications. Cipla a major Indian pharmaceutical firm set out to address this problem by formulating an affordable generic alternative but they soon ran into a roadblock when several drug companies who owned patents on antiretroviral medicines took legal action to prevent distribution of low-cost variants on their products. The distribution of Cipla's product put life-saving drugs in the hands of ten times more patients than before but does this humanitarian effort deny another firm's right to make a profit? This battle of principle over property is examined in the documentary Fire In The Blood which also presents the story of the spread of AIDS in the Third World and profiles Zackie Achmat a South African activist who refused AIDS treatment until affordable drugs were available to all who needed them.

When the latest in a depressing series of unsuccessful job interviews leaves Roberto's future looking particularly grim he realizes he can no longer keep his family's dire finances a secret and suffers a momentary bout of insanity that leaves him hanging between life and death. Determined to do something nice for his wife on their anniversary he goes to the hotel where they spent their honeymoon and finds that a Roman theatre has been unearthed on the site. It's currently being transformed into a museum but before the mayor and museum director have a chance to bring in the press Roberto sneaks into the location and suffers a terrible fall while fleeing from security guards. As a result his skull is pierced by an iron rod that bisects his brain. Since it hasn't caused any actual damage Roberto is awake alert and able to communicate with his wife. But when the doctor called in to assess the situation reveals that the rod is pressing on a sinus canal that drains the blood from the brain to the jugular they realize that any attempt to move him could kill him. Concerned for his children's future Roberto seizes an opportunity to turn his own personal tragedy into a monetary windfall for them and hires an agent. Before long all spotlights are shining on Roberto. His plan seems to be working but what he doesn't understand is that his wife would rather have a husband and father in the house than money in the bank., , Common Wealth | Il volto di un'altra | Ace in the Hole | Viaje de generación | The Exterminating Angel | The Truman Show

At the outset of the story thirteen French theater actors each receive a call informing them that the stage director Antoine d'Anthac has died. These thespians share a common thread -- all appeared previously in various productions of Jean Anouilh's play Eurydice. The players get summoned to one of d'Anthac's mansions (a trope lifted from Anouilh's Dear Antoine) where they are asked to evaluate taped versions of a new theatrical company's take on Eurydice. In the process the film begins to cut between several contrasting "visions" of the play beginning with a stripped-down warehouse-set rendition of it. Throughout several different French couples portray the doomed lovers Orpheus and Eurydice. The interpretations vie with one another for the guests' shared attention. As the performers follow the action with wide eyes they instinctively begin to repeat passages of dialogue and then physically step into green-screened scenes from the production. Among Resnais' many themes in the film is the extent of the loyalty and devotion that actors may begin to feel for a particular director; appropriately enough then many in the cast of this film had worked with Resnais on several prior occasions., , Life of Riley | Bicycling With Molière | Under the Rainbow | Vanya on 42nd Street | All About Eve | Fame

It was the beginning of a curious partnership that culminated in the creation of a collaborative art exhibition dubbed "The House That Herman Built" which challenged observer's perceptions of prison by contrasting a full-scale wooden replica of Wallace's cell against blueprints for his dream home.

When Josie learns of Jim's request despite her children's best efforts to keep it a secret she erupts due to years of pent up anger and resentment. Meanwhile as grieving widower Gerry finds his friendship with the nurse (Connie Britton) hired to care for his late wife's mother growing into something much more intimate the rest of his siblings contend with their own personal crises., , The Brothers McMullen | Nothing Like the Holidays | Sidewalks of New York | Two Family House | About a Boy | How Do You Know

Fayyad sought to set aside divisiveness and instead asked Palestinians to imagine what sort of a state they would want and then take concrete steps towards making it a reality. Fayyad's campaign which he freely admitted was inspired by the program that led to the U.S.'s recognition of Israel in 1949 earned the respect of a number of international leaders and helped establish a common ground between many activists in the Middle East but the plan fell short of its goals. Filmmaker Dan Setton profiles Salam Fayyad and chronicles his efforts to bring Palestine to the United Nations in the documentary State 194.

Delisle intercuts five mini-narratives each spoken entirely in first-person voiceover by a different character. One is a fortysomething man (Delisle) who committed a hit-and-run tried to dispose of the body and was sent to prison; another is a down-on-his luck drug dealer with extreme facial injuries wrought by his "trade"; a third is an elderly woman heartsick over her son's incarceration and her sister's terminal illness; a fourth is a young woman still contending with a separation from her lover and attempting to start fresh; and the fifth is a prison guard juggling an emotionally trying job with family issues. As the movie rolls forward it becomes apparent that all of these individuals' lives are connected via that of the hit-and-run perpetrator. Though the movie does contain some live-action footage Delislemostly enlists a preponderance of single images (shown with the narration atop them) that have metaphoric connotations tied to the movie's stories - such as waterfalls rivers time-lapse shots of cloud banks roses and very occasionally fauna. The history of this motion picture is as unusual and unexpected as its content: it actually began as a book of photographs and evolved into a feature script as Delisle spontaneously wrote the monologues drawing some inspiration from emotional experiences and journeys in his own life., , Hiroshima Mon Amour | The Designated Mourner | 21 Grams | Magnolia | The Best Years of Our Lives | Grand Canyon

The only way that Stephen his family and his colleagues manage to stay afloat is to sell directly to customers instead of working through a middle man. As Heathcote and Bachelier observe Stephen's démarche - his routine of feeding the cows healing their wounds emotionally reassuring them helping to birth their calves and much more - the film pulls us into a slow laid back and lyrical way of life that exists at odds with the technology of the surrounding world., , Heart & Soil | Beautiful Krista | Shane | Samsara | Off and Running | The Best Years of Our Lives

Years later Isaac has grown into an award-winning photographer. An art gallery in Greece is preparing an exhibition of his work but just before Isaac prepares to leave his father dies under mysterious circumstance. His late father's ashes in tow Isaac departs for Athens where a disturbing clash with his distant relatives and a troubling encounter with a desperate young boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) lead him to investigate the dark mystery surrounding his family name. At first Isaac is laughingly dismissive of the idea that his bloodline has somehow been cursed but as his travels lead him from his father's village in Greece to Paris and Budapest where his drug-addicted brother profits from the sexual slavery of children the once-skeptical photographer learns that everything he thought he knew about his past was a lie and that the sins of his father still possess frightening power., , The Abandoned | Ordinary People | Interiors | Return | Thérèse | Death of a Salesman
